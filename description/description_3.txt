Adverse ReactionsREPREXAIN™ was administered to approximately 300 pain patients in a safety study that employed dosages and a duration of treatment sufficient to encompass the recommended usage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Adverse event rates generally increased with increasing daily dose. The event rates reported below are from approximately 150 patients who were in a group that received one tablet of REPREXAIN™ an average of three to four times daily. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in the trials were fairly similar for this patient group and those who received the comparison treatment, acetaminophen 600 mg with codeine 60 mg. The following lists adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1% or greater in clinical trials of REPREXAIN™, without regard to the causal relationship of the events to the drug. To distinguish different rates of occurrence in clinical studies, the adverse events are listed as follows: name of adverse event = less than 3% adverse events marked with an asterisk * = 3% to 9% adverse event rates over 9% are in parentheses.

Drug Abuse and Dependence Misuse Abuse and Diversion of Opioids REPREXAIN™ contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule III controlled substance. REPREXAIN™, and other opioids used in analgesia can be abused and are subject to criminal diversion. Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common. “Drug seeking” behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). “Doctor shopping” to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physical dependence usually assumes clinically significant dimensions only after several weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of opioid therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia, is manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients. Physicians should be aware that abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. REPREXAIN™, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. Record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events • Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use [see Warnings and Precautions ]. • Etodolac extended-release tablets arecontraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [see Contraindications and Warnings ]. Gastrointestinal Risk • NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see WARNINGS).ADVERSE REACTIONS A total of 1552 patients were exposed to etodolac extended-release tablets in controlled clinical studies of at least 4 weeks in length and using daily doses in the range of 400 to 1200 mg. In the tabulations below, adverse event rates are generally categorized based on the incidence of events in the first 30 days of treatment with etodolac extended-release tablets. As with other NSAIDs, the cumulative adverse event rates may increase significantly over time with extended therapy. In patients taking NSAIDs, including etodolac extended-release tablets, the most frequently reported adverse experiences occurring in approximately 1 to 10% of patients are: Gastrointestinal experiences including abdominal pain constipation Diarrhea dyspepsia flatulence GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal)* gross bleeding/perforation* nausea Vomiting Other events including: abnormal renal functionAdverse events that were observed in < 1% of patients in the first 30 days of treatment with etodolac extended-release tablets in clinical trials.
