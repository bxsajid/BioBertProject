    "5.\tWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n\n\nSerious and potentially fatal cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke.  Patients with known CV disease/risk factors may be at greater risk (\n          \n  \n     5.1, \n          \n  \n     14.6, \n          \n  \n     17.2). \n         \n \n    \nSerious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, which can be fatal.  The risk is greater in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding, and in patients at high risk for GI events, especially the elderly. Celecoxib should be used with caution in these patients (\n          \n  \n     5.4, \n          \n  \n     8.5, \n          \n  \n     14.6, \n          \n  \n     17.3).\n         \n \n    \nElevated liver enzymes and, rarely, severe hepatic reactions.  Discontinue use of celecoxib immediately if abnormal liver enzymes persist or worsen (\n          \n  \n     5.5, \n          \n  \n     17.4).\n         \n \n    \nNew onset or worsening of hypertension.  Blood pressure should be monitored closely during treatment with celecoxib (\n          \n  \n     5.2, \n          \n  \n     7.4, \n          \n  \n     17.2).\n         \n \n    \nFluid retention and edema.  Celecoxib should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure (\n          \n  \n     5.3, \n          \n  \n     17.6).\n         \n \n    \nRenal papillary necrosis and other renal injury with long term use.  Use celecoxib with caution in the elderly, those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, and those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, or angiotensin II antagonists (\n          \n  \n     5.6, \n          \n  \n     7.4, \n          \n  \n     8.7, \n          \n  \n     17.6).\n         \n \n    \nAnaphylactoid reactions.  Do not use celecoxib in patients with the aspirin triad (\n          \n  \n     5.7, \n          \n  \n     10, \n          \n  \n     17.7).\n         \n \n    \nSerious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal and can occur without warning even without known prior sulfa allergy.  Discontinue celecoxib at first appearance of rash or skin reactions (\n          \n  \n     5.8, \n          \n  \n     17.5).\n         \n \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events\n\nChronic use of celecoxib may cause an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.  In the APC (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) trial, the hazard ratio for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 – 8.5) for celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 – 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily compared to placebo.  Cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3.0% (20/671 subjects) and 2.5% (17/685 subjects), respectively, compared to 0.9% (6/679 subjects) with placebo treatment. The increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo-treated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Clinical Studies (14.6)\n].\n        \n\n \nAll NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and non-selective, may have a similar risk.  Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk.  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with celecoxib, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.  Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.  Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV toxicity and the steps to take if they occur.\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.  The concurrent use of aspirin and celecoxib does increase the risk of serious GI events [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)\n]. \n        \n\n \nTwo large, controlled, clinical trials of a different COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (4)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Hypertension\n\nAs with all NSAIDs, celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.  Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs.  NSAIDs, including celecoxib, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with celecoxib and throughout the course of therapy.  The rates of hypertension from the CLASS trial in the celecoxib, ibuprofen and diclofenac-treated patients were 2.4%, 4.2% and 2.5%, respectively [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Clinical Studies (14.6)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Congestive Heart Failure and Edema\n\nFluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs, including celecoxib [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n]. In the CLASS study [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Clinical Studies (14.6)\n], the Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months of peripheral edema in patients on celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 4.5%, 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively.  Celecoxib should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation  \n\nNSAIDs, including celecoxib, can cause serious gastrointestinal events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal.  These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.  Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic.  Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA.  Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [\n           \n \n  see \n            \n  \n   Clinical Studies (14.6)\n].  With longer duration of use of NSAIDs, there is a trend for increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy.  However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.\n          \n\n \nNSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors.  Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status.  Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population.\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.  Physicians and patients should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during celecoxib therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected.  For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.\nCelecoxib is contraindicated in patients with active GI bleeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Hepatic Effects\n\nBorderline elevations of one or more liver-associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs.  These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy.  Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including celecoxib [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n]. In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.\n        \n\n \nA patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with celecoxib.  If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), celecoxib should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Renal Effects\n\nLong-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.  Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion.  In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.  Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the elderly.  Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.  Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs.\nNo information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease.  Therefore, treatment with celecoxib is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease.  If celecoxib therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7 Anaphylactoid Reactions\n\nAs with NSAIDs in general, anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients without known prior exposure to celecoxib.  In post-marketing experience, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported in patients receiving celecoxib.  Celecoxib should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad.  This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Contraindications (4), \n          \n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (5.7)\n].  Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.8 Skin Reactions\n\nCelecoxib is a sulfonamide and can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal.  These serious events can occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy.  Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.9\tPregnancy\n\nIn late pregnancy, starting at 30 weeks gestation, celecoxib should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Use in Specific Populations (8.1)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.10 Corticosteroid Treatment\n\nCelecoxib cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency.  Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness.  Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.11 Hematological Effects\n\nAnemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving celecoxib. In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo.  Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss.  Celecoxib does not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and does not inhibit platelet aggregation at indicated dosages [\n         \n \n  see \n          \n  \n   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)\n].\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.12 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)\n\nCelecoxib should be used only with caution in pediatric patients with systemic onset JRA due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.13 Preexisting Asthma\n\nPatients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma.  The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal.  Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.14 Laboratory Tests\n\nBecause serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically.  If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, celecoxib should be discontinued.\nIn controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo.  This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.15 Inflammation\n\nThe pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.16 Concomitant NSAID Use\n\nThe concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.",
    "6.\tADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nOf the celecoxib-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of celecoxib of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received celecoxib at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more.\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.  The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost common adverse reactions in arthritis trials (>2% and >placebo): abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, peripheral edema, accidental injury, dizziness, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, rash (\n         \n \n    6.1). \n        \n\n   \n\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc\n          \n  \n     . at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch\n         \n \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Pre-marketing Controlled Arthritis Trials\n\nTable 1 lists all adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥2% of patients receiving celecoxib from 12 controlled studies conducted in patients with OA or RA that included a placebo and/or a positive control group.

The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse events in celecoxib treated patients were headache, fever (pyrexia), upper abdominal pain, cough, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, nausea, arthralgia, diarrhea and vomiting.  The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse experiences for naproxen-treated patients were headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, abdominal pain, and dizziness (Table 2).  Compared with naproxen, celecoxib at doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg BID had no observable deleterious effect on growth and development during the course of the 12-week double-blind study. There was no substantial difference in the number of clinical exacerbations of uveitis or systemic features of JRA among treatment groups.\nIn a 12-week, open-label extension of the double-blind study described above, 202 JRA patients were treated with celecoxib 6 mg/kg BID.  The incidence of adverse events was similar to that observed during the double-blind study; no unexpected adverse events of clinical importance emerged.\n\nTable 2: Adverse Events Occurring in ≥5% of JRA Patients in Any Treatment Group, by System Organ Class (% of patients with events)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll  Doses Twice Daily\n\n\nSystem Organ Class\n            \n    \n       Preferred Term\n           \n   \n    \nCelecoxib\n            \n    \n     3  mg/kg\n            \n    \n     N=77\n           \n   \n    \nCelecoxib\n            \n    \n     6  mg/kg\n            \n    \n     N=82\n           \n   \n    \nNaproxen\n            \n    \n     7.5  mg/kg\n            \n    \n     N=83\n           \n   \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nAny Event\n\n\n64\n\n\n70\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\nEye Disorders\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal\n\n\n26\n\n\n24\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n  Abdominal pain  NOS\n4\n7\n7\n\n\n  Abdominal pain upper\n8\n6\n10\n\n\n  Vomiting NOS\n3\n6\n11\n\n\n  Diarrhea NOS\n5\n4\n8\n\n\n  Nausea\n7\n4\n11\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n13\n\n\n11\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n  Pyrexia\n8\n9\n11\n\n\n\nInfections \n\n\n25\n\n\n20\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n  Nasopharyngitis\n5\n6\n5\n\n\n\nInjury and Poisoning \n\n\n4\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nInvestigations\n             \n     \n      Abnormal laboratory tests, which include:  Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, Bacteriuria NOS present, Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, Blood culture positive, Blood glucose increased, Blood pressure increased, Blood uric acid increased, Hematocrit decreased, Hematuria present, Hemoglobin decreased, Liver function tests NOS abnormal, Proteinuria present, Transaminase NOS increased, Urine analysis abnormal NOS\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n11\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal \n\n\n8\n\n\n10\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n  Arthralgia\n3\n7\n4\n\n\n\nNervous System\n\n\n17\n\n\n11\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n  Headache  NOS\n13\n10\n16\n\n\n  Dizziness  (excl vertigo)\n1\n1\n7\n\n\n\nRespiratory\n\n\n8\n\n\n15\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n  Cough\n7\n7\n8\n\n\n\nSkin & Subcutaneous\n\n\n10\n\n\n7\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4 Other Pre-Approval Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Events from Ankylosing Spondylitis Studies: \nA total of 378 patients were treated with celecoxib in placebo- and active-controlled AS studies.

    "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop (5.3)\n\nHypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure (5.4, 7)\n\nHeart Failure and Edema: Avoid use of celecoxib in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure (5.5)\n\nRenal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function (5.6)\n\nAnaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs (5.7)\n\nExacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity) (5.8)\n\nSerious Skin Reactions: Discontinue celecoxib at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity (5.9)\n\nPremature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (5.10, 8.1)\n\nHematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia (5.11, 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1\tCardiovascular Thrombotic Events\n\n\nClinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. \n\n\nThe relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.\n\nIn the APC (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) trial, the hazard ratio for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 – 8.5) for celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 – 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily compared to placebo. Cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3.0% (20/671 subjects) and 2.5% (17/685 subjects), respectively, compared to 0.9% (6/679 subjects) with placebo treatment. The increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo-treated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction [see Clinical Studies (14.6)\n].\n\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\n\n\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as celecoxib, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery \n\n\nTwo large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)\n]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-MI Patients\n\n\nObservational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.\n\n\nAvoid the use of celecoxib in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If celecoxib is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2\tGastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation\n\nNSAIDs, including celecoxib cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with celecoxib. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation \n\nPatients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.\nComplicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:\n\n\nUse the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.\nAvoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.\nAvoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.\nRemain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.\nIf a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue celecoxib until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.\nIn the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3\tHepatotoxicity\n\nElevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.\nElevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including celecoxib. \nIn controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.\nInform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue celecoxib immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4\tHypertension\n\nNSAIDs, including celecoxib can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)\n]. \nThe rates of hypertension from the CLASS trial in the celecoxib, ibuprofen and diclofenac-treated patients were 2.4%, 4.2% and 2.5%, respectively [see \nClinical Studies (14.6)\n].\nMonitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5\tHeart Failure and Edema\n\n\nThe Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.\n\n\nAdditionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of celecoxib may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7)\n].\n\n\nIn the CLASS study [see Clinical Studies (14.6)\n], the Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months of peripheral edema in patients on celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 4.5%, 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively. \n\n\nAvoid the use of celecoxib in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If celecoxib is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6\tRenal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenal Toxicity \n\nLong-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. \nRenal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\nNo information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. \nCorrect volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib [see Drug Interactions (7)\n]. Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperkalemia\n\nIncreases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic- hypoadosteronism state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7\tAnaphylactic Reactions\n\nCelecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people [see \nContraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)\n]. \nSeek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.8\tExacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity\n\nA subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)\n]. When celecoxib is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.9\tSerious Skin Reactions\n\nSerious skin reactions have occurred following treatment with celecoxib, including erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). These serious events may occur without warning and can be fatal. \nInform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of celecoxib at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.10\tPremature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus\n\nCelecoxib may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including celecoxib, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.11\tHematological Toxicity\n\nAnemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with celecoxib has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. \nIn controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss.\nNSAIDs, including celecoxib, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.12\tMasking of Inflammation and Fever\n\nThe pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.13\tLaboratory Monitoring\n\nBecause serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)\n].\nIn controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.14\tDisseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)\n\nBecause of the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation with use of celecoxib in pediatric patients with systemic onset JRA, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of abnormal clotting or bleeding, and inform patients and their caregivers to report symptoms as soon as possible.",
    "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\nCardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)\n]\nGI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)\n]\nHepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)\n]\nHypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)\n]\nHeart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)\n]\nRenal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)\n]\nAnaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)\n]\nSerious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)\n]\nHematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost common adverse reactions in arthritis trials (>2% and >placebo) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, peripheral edema, accidental injury, dizziness, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, rash (6.1).\n\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1\tClinical Trials Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.\nOf the celecoxib-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of celecoxib of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received celecoxib at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-marketing Controlled Arthritis Trials\n\nTable 1 lists all adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥2% of patients receiving celecoxib from 12 controlled studies conducted in patients with OA or RA that included a placebo and/or a positive control group. Since these 12 trials were of different durations, and patients in the trials may not have been exposed for the same duration of time, these percentages do not capture cumulative rates of occurrence.\n\nTable 1: Adverse Events Occurring in ≥2% of Celecoxib Patients from Pre-marketing Controlled Arthritis Trials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBXN=4146\nPlaceboN=1864\nNAPN=1366\nDCFN=387\nIBUN=345\n\n\n\n\nCBX = Celecoxib 100 – 200 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily; NAP = Naproxen 500 mg twice daily;DCF = Diclofenac 75 mg twice daily;IBU = Ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily.\n\n\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Abdominal Pain\n4.1%\n2.8%\n7.7%\n9.0%\n9.0%\n\n\n  Diarrhea\n5.6%\n3.8%\n5.3%\n9.3%\n5.8%\n\n\n  Dyspepsia\n8.8%\n6.2%\n12.2%\n10.9%\n12.8%\n\n\n  Flatulence\n2.2%\n1.0%\n3.6%\n4.1%\n3.5%\n\n\n  Nausea\n3.5%\n4.2%\n6.0%\n3.4%\n6.7%\n\n\n\nBody as a whole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Back Pain\n2.8%\n3.6%\n2.2%\n2.6%\n0.9%\n\n\n  Peripheral Edema\n2.1%\n1.1%\n2.1%\n1.0%\n3.5%\n\n\n  Injury-Accidental\n2.9%\n2.3%\n3.0%\n2.6%\n3.2%\n\n\n\nCentral, Peripheral Nervous system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Dizziness\n2.0%\n1.7%\n2.6%\n1.3%\n2.3%\n\n\n  Headache\n15.8%\n20.2%\n14.5%\n15.5%\n15.4%\n\n\n\nPsychiatric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Insomnia\n2.3%\n2.3%\n2.9%\n1.3%\n1.4%\n\n\n\nRespiratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Pharyngitis\n2.3%\n1.1%\n1.7%\n1.6%\n2.6%\n\n\n  Rhinitis\n2.0%\n1.3%\n2.4%\n2.3%\n0.6%\n\n\n  Sinusitis\n5.0%\n4.3%\n4.0%\n5.4%\n5.8%\n\n\n  Upper Respiratory Infection\n8.1%\n6.7%\n9.9%\n9.8%\n9.9%\n\n\n\nSkin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Rash\n2.2%\n2.1%\n2.1%\n1.3%\n1.2%\n\n\n\nIn placebo- or active-controlled clinical trials, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 7.1% for patients receiving celecoxib and 6.1% for patients receiving placebo. Among the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse events in the celecoxib treatment groups were dyspepsia and abdominal pain (cited as reasons for discontinuation in 0.8% and 0.7% of celecoxib patients, respectively). Among patients receiving placebo, 0.6% discontinued due to dyspepsia and 0.6% withdrew due to abdominal pain.\n\nThe following adverse reactions occurred in 0.1 – 1.9% of patients treated with celecoxib (100 – 200 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal\n:\n\nConstipation, diverticulitis, dysphagia, eructation, esophagitis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastroesophageal reflux, hemorrhoids, hiatal hernia, melena, dry mouth, stomatitis, tenesmus, vomiting\n\n\n\nCardiovascular:\n\nAggravated hypertension, angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, myocardial infarction\n\n\n\nGeneral\n:\n\nHypersensitivity, allergic reaction, chest pain, cyst NOS, edema generalized, face edema, fatigue, fever, hot flushes, influenza-like symptoms, pain, peripheral pain\n\n\n\nCentral, peripheral nervous system:\n\nLeg cramps, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, paresthesia, vertigo\n\n\n\nHearing and vestibular\n:\n\nDeafness, tinnitus\n\n\n\nHeart rate and rhythm\n:\n\nPalpitation, tachycardia\n\n\n\nLiver and biliary\n:\n\nHepatic enzyme increased (including SGOT increased, SGPT increased)\n\n\n\nMetabolic and nutritional\n:\n\nBUN increased, CPK increased, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, NPN increased, creatinine increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, weight increased\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal\n:\n\nArthralgia, arthrosis, myalgia, synovitis, tendinitis\n\n\n\nPlatelets (bleeding or clotting)\n:\n\nEcchymosis, epistaxis, thrombocythemia,\n\n\n\nPsychiatric\n:\n\nAnorexia, anxiety, appetite increased, depression, nervousness, somnolence\n\n\n\nHemic\n:\n\nAnemia\n\n\n\nRespiratory\n:\n\nBronchitis, bronchospasm, bronchospasm aggravated, cough, dyspnea, laryngitis, pneumonia\n\n\n\nSkin and appendages\n:\n\nAlopecia, dermatitis, photosensitivity reaction, pruritus, rash erythematous, rash maculopapular, skin disorder, skin dry, sweating increased, urticaria\n\n\n\nApplication site disorders\n:\n\nCellulitis, dermatitis contact\n\n\n\nUrinary\n:\n\nAlbuminuria, cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, micturition frequency, renal calculus\n\n\n\n\nThe following serious adverse events (causality not evaluated) occurred in <0.1% of patients:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardiovascular\n:\n\nSyncope, congestive heart failure, ventricular fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral gangrene, thrombophlebitis\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal\n:\n\nIntestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, colitis with bleeding, esophageal perforation, pancreatitis, ileus \n\n\n\nGeneral:\n\nSepsis, sudden death\n\n\n\nLiver and biliary\n:\n\nCholelithiasis\n\n\n\nHemic and lymphatic\n:\n\nThrombocytopenia\n\n\n\nNervous\n:\n\nAtaxia, suicide [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]\n\n\n\n\nRenal\n:\n\nAcute renal failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study [see \nSpecial Studies (14.6)\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHematological Events: The incidence of clinically significant decreases in hemoglobin (>2 g/dL) was lower in patients on celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (0.5%) compared to patients on either diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (1.3%) or ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily 1.9%. The lower incidence of events with celecoxib was maintained with or without aspirin use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithdrawals/Serious Adverse Events: Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months for withdrawals due to adverse events for celecoxib, diclofenac and ibuprofen were 24%, 29%, and 26%, respectively. Rates for serious adverse events (i.e., causing hospitalization or felt to be life-threatening or otherwise medically significant), regardless of causality, were not different across treatment groups (8%, 7%, and 8%, respectively).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis Study\n\nIn a 12-week, double-blind, active-controlled study, 242 JRA patients 2 years to 17 years of age were treated with celecoxib or naproxen; 77 JRA patients were treated with celecoxib 3 mg/kg twice daily, 82 patients were treated with celecoxib 6 mg/kg twice daily, and 83 patients were treated with naproxen 7.5 mg/kg twice daily. The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse events in celecoxib treated patients were headache, fever (pyrexia), upper abdominal pain, cough, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, nausea, arthralgia, diarrhea and vomiting. The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse experiences for naproxen-treated patients were headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, abdominal pain, and dizziness (Table 2). Compared with naproxen, celecoxib at doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg twice daily had no observable deleterious effect on growth and development during the course of the 12-week double-blind study. There was no substantial difference in the number of clinical exacerbations of uveitis or systemic features of JRA among treatment groups.\nIn a 12-week, open-label extension of the double-blind study described above, 202 JRA patients were treated with celecoxib 6 mg/kg twice daily. The incidence of adverse events was similar to that observed during the double-blind study; no unexpected adverse events of clinical importance emerged.\n\nTable 2: Adverse Events Occurring in ≥5% of JRA Patients in Any Treatment Group, by System Organ Class (% of patients with events)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll  Doses Twice Daily\n\n\nSystem Organ Class  Preferred Term\nCelecoxib3  mg/kgN=77\nCelecoxib6  mg/kgN=82\nNaproxen7.5  mg/kgN=83\n\n\n\n\n\nAny Event\n\n\n64\n\n\n70\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\nEye Disorders\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nGastrointestinal\n\n\n26\n\n\n24\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n  Abdominal pain  NOS\n4\n7\n7\n\n\n  Abdominal pain upper\n8\n6\n10\n\n\n  Vomiting NOS\n3\n6\n11\n\n\n  Diarrhea NOS\n5\n4\n8\n\n\n  Nausea\n7\n4\n11\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n13\n\n\n11\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n  Pyrexia\n8\n9\n11\n\n\n\nInfections \n\n\n25\n\n\n20\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n  Nasopharyngitis\n5\n6\n5\n\n\n\nInjury and Poisoning \n\n\n4\n\n\n6\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nInvestigationsAbnormal laboratory tests, which include: Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, Bacteriuria NOS present, Blood creatine phosphokinase increased, Blood culture positive, Blood glucose increased, Blood pressure increased, Blood uric acid increased, Hematocrit decreased, Hematuria present, Hemoglobin decreased, Liver function tests NOS abnormal, Proteinuria present, Transaminase NOS increased, Urine analysis abnormal NOS\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n11\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal \n\n\n8\n\n\n10\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n  Arthralgia\n3\n7\n4\n\n\n\nNervous System\n\n\n17\n\n\n11\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n  Headache  NOS\n13\n10\n16\n\n\n  Dizziness  (excl vertigo)\n1\n1\n7\n\n\n\nRespiratory\n\n\n8\n\n\n15\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n  Cough\n7\n7\n8\n\n\n\nSkin & Subcutaneous\n\n\n10\n\n\n7\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Pre-Approval Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Events from Ankylosing Spondylitis Studies: A total of 378 patients were treated with celecoxib in placebo- and active-controlled AS studies.

The types of adverse events reported in the AS studies were similar to those reported in the OA/RA studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Events from Analgesia and Dysmenorrhea Studies: Approximately 1,700 patients were treated with celecoxib in analgesia and dysmenorrhea studies. All patients in post-oral surgery pain studies received a single dose of study medication. Doses up to 600 mg/day of celecoxib were studied in primary dysmenorrhea and post-orthopedic surgery pain studies. The types of adverse events in the analgesia and dysmenorrhea studies were similar to those reported in arthritis studies.
