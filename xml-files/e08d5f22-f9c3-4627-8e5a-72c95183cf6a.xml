                     <text>
                        <paragraph>TREXIMET contains sumatriptan, a 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist that mediates vasoconstriction of the human basilar artery and vasculature of human dura mater, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. It also contains naproxen, an NSAID that inhibits the synthesis of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, sumatriptan and naproxen contribute to the relief of migraine through pharmacologically different mechanisms of action.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sumatriptan is a 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist that binds with high affinity to 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors. Sumatriptan has only a weak affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>5A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors and no significant affinity (as measured using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity at 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3, </sub>or 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor subtypes or at alpha<sub>1</sub>-, alpha<sub>2</sub>-, or beta-adrenergic; dopamine<sub>1</sub>; dopamine<sub>2</sub>; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that sumatriptan also activates 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels. Such an action may contribute to the antimigrainous effect of sumatriptan in humans. In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Naproxen sodium is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties. The sodium salt of naproxen has been developed as a more rapidly absorbed formulation of naproxen for use as an analgesic. The mechanism of action of the naproxen anion, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>TREXIMET is a formulation of 85Â mg of sumatriptan (as sumatriptan succinate) and 500Â mg of naproxen sodium with a distinct pharmacokinetic profile. C<sub>max</sub> (median, range) for sumatriptan following administration of TREXIMET occurs at approximately 1 hour (0.3 to 4.0Â hours). C<sub>max</sub> (median, range) for naproxen following administration of TREXIMET occurs at approximately 5Â hours (0.3 to 12Â hours). The sumatriptan half-life is approximately 2Â hours (15% to 43% CV) and the naproxen half-life is approximately 19Â hours (13% to 15% CV). The mean C<sub>max</sub> for sumatriptan when given as TREXIMET is similar to that of sumatriptan when given as IMITREX<sup>Â®</sup> (sumatriptan succinate) Tablets 100Â mg alone. The median sumatriptan T<sub>max</sub> is only slightly different (1Â hour for TREXIMET and 1.5Â hours for IMITREX). The C<sub>max</sub> for naproxen is approximately 36% lower, and the T<sub>max</sub> occurs approximately 4Â hours later from TREXIMET than from ANAPROX<sup>Â®</sup> DS (naproxen sodium tablets) 550Â mg. AUC values for sumatriptan and for naproxen are similar for TREXIMET compared to IMITREX or ANAPROX DS, respectively. In a crossover study in 16 patients, the pharmacokinetics of both components administered as TREXIMET were similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period.</paragraph>

                           </content> Bioavailability of sumatriptan is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic (first-pass) metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The volume of distribution of naproxen is 0.16 L/kg. At therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day, there is a less than proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough C<sub>ss</sub> = 36.5, 49.2, and 56.4 mg/L with 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively).

Three percent of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: <content styleCode="italics">Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors</content>). No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The clearance of naproxen is 0.13Â mL/min/kg. Approximately 95% of the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen (less than 1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (less than 1%), or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans is approximately 19Â hours. The corresponding half-lives of both metabolites and conjugates of naproxen are shorter than 12Â hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide closely with the rate of naproxen disappearance from the plasma. In patients with renal failure, metabolites may accumulate (see PRECAUTIONS: Renal Effects).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of TREXIMET in providing relief from migraine was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group trials utilizing placebo and each individual active component of TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) as comparison treatments. Patients enrolled in these 2 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (88%), with a mean age of 40Â years (range 18 to 65Â years). Patients were instructed to treat a migraine of moderate to severe pain with 1Â tablet. No rescue medication was allowed within 2Â hours postdose. Patients evaluated their headache pain 2Â hours after taking 1 dose of study medication; headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain. Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also evaluated. Sustained pain free was defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to no pain at 2Â hours postdose without a return of mild, moderate, or severe pain and no use of rescue medication for 24Â hours postdose. The results from the 2 controlled clinical trials are summarized in TableÂ 1. In both trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache pain relief 2Â hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving TREXIMET (65% and 57%) compared with those who received placebo (28% and 29%).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Further, the percentage of patients who remained pain free without use of other medications through 24Â hours postdose was significantly greater among patients receiving a single dose of TREXIMET (25% and 23%) compared with those who received placebo (8% and 7%) or either sumatriptan (16% and 14%) or naproxen sodium (10%) alone.</paragraph>

It is also contraindicated in patients in whom aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory/analgesic drugs induce the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions to naproxen, whether of the true allergic type or the pharmacologic idiosyncratic type (e.g., aspirin hypersensitivity syndrome), usually but not always occur in patients with a known history of such reactions. Both types of reactions have the potential of being fatal. Therefore, careful questioning of patients for medical conditions such as asthma, nasal polyps, urticaria, and hypotension associated with NSAIDs before starting therapy is important. In addition, if such symptoms occur during therapy, treatment should be discontinued (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Preexisting Asthma).</content>

                              </content> TREXIMET should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) or to patients with a history of CABG surgery (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan-containing products not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40Â years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of CAD and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patientâs medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, TREXIMET should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</content>

Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following first-time use of TREXIMET in patients with risk factors.</content>

Considering the extent of use of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The fact that sumatriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, that some of these events have occurred in patients with no prior cardiac disease history and with documented absence of CAD, and the close proximity of the events to sumatriptan use support the conclusion that some of these cases were caused by the drug. In cases, however, where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain.</paragraph>

                           </content> Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years' duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse cardiovascular event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous cardiovascular symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal events (see WARNINGS: Risk of Gastrointestinal Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation With Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Therapy).</paragraph>

The relationship of sumatriptan to these events is uncertain. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, sumatriptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should also be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including treatment with TREXIMET, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). If concomitant treatment with TREXIMET and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram) or SNRI (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</paragraph>

                     </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>TREXIMET contains an NSAID. NSAID-containing products can cause serious gastrointestinal adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper gastrointestinal adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs appear to occur in approximately 1% of patients treated daily for 3 to 6Â months and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for 1Â year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious gastrointestinal event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Among 3,302 patients with migraine who received TREXIMET in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 1 patient experienced a recurrence of gastric ulcer after taking 8 doses over 3 weeks, and 1 patient developed a gastric ulcer after treating an average of 8 attacks per month over 7 months. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAID-containing products, including TREXIMET, should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal gastrointestinal events are in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse gastrointestinal event in patients treated with an NSAID-containing product, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious gastrointestinal adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious gastrointestinal adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

TREXIMET should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in patients with asthma who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, PRECAUTIONS: Preexisting Asthma, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a fatal outcome.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following TREXIMET should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of TREXIMET and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome, following TREXIMET should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Effects).</paragraph>

Borderline elevations of 1 or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients who take NSAID-containing products. These abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Notable (3 times the upper limit of normal) elevations of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes, have been reported with NSAIDs. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with TREXIMET.

Because there could be an accumulation in melanin-rich tissues over time, sumatriptan could possibly cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. However, no effects on the retina related to treatment with sumatriptan were noted in any of the oral or subcutaneous toxicity studies. Although no systematic monitoring of ophthalmologic function was undertaken in clinical trials and no specific recommendations for ophthalmologic monitoring are offered, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including TREXIMET, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross gastrointestinal blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients receiving TREXIMET who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored. NSAID-containing products inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregnancy Category C. In developmental toxicity studies in rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan combined with naproxen sodium (5/9, 25/45, or 50/90Â mg/kg/day sumatriptan/naproxen sodium) or each drug alone (50/0 or 0/90Â mg/kg/day sumatriptan/naproxen sodium) resulted in decreased fetal body weight in all treated groups and in increased embryofetal death at the highest dose of naproxen, alone and in combination with sumatriptan. Naproxen sodium, alone and in combination with sumatriptan, increased the total incidences of fetal abnormalities at all doses and increased the incidences of specific malformations (cardiac interventricular septal defect in the 50/90-mg/kg/day group, fused caudal vertebrae in the 50/0- and 0/90-mg/kg/day groups) and variations (absent intermediate lobe of the lung, irregular ossification of the skull, incompletely ossified sternal centra) in the 50/0- and 0/90-mg/kg/day groups. A no-effect dose for development toxicity in rabbits was not established. The lowest effect dose was 5/9Â mg/kg/day sumatriptan/naproxen sodium, which was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to sumatriptan and naproxen that were 1.4 and 0.14 times, respectively, those attained at the maximum recommended human oral daily dose of 85Â mg sumatriptan and 500Â mg naproxen sodium.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In previous developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities and decreased pup survival at doses of 250Â mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60Â mg/kg/day, which is approximately 7Â times the recommended human oral daily dose of 85Â mg sumatriptan on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities at a dose of 50Â mg/kg/day and embryolethality at 100Â mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for embryotoxicity in rabbits was 15Â mg/kg/day, or approximately 3Â times the recommended human oral daily dose of 85Â mg sumatriptan on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (including naproxen) are known to delay parturition. Because of this and the known effects of drugs of this class on the human fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), use during third trimester should be avoided.</paragraph>

Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more with TREXIMET and were more frequent than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving TREXIMET and occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group included asthenia, feeling hot, muscle tightness, and palpitations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>TREXIMET was generally well tolerated. Most adverse reactions were mild and transient. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The occurrence of less commonly reported adverse clinical events is presented in this section. Because the reports include events observed in an open-label, long-term safety study in which TREXIMET was used as needed for up to 12Â months, the role of TREXIMET cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used TREXIMET and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (NÂ =Â 3,302) exposed to TREXIMET. Events listed in the previous table and text are not included below. Those events described too generally to be informative or those unlikely to be associated with the use of TREXIMET are excluded. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. </paragraph>

               <title>OVERDOSAGE</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There have been no reports of overdosage with TREXIMET. Since sumatriptan and naproxen have pharmacologically different actions, it is difficult to predict how an individual will respond to an overdosage with TREXIMET.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients (NÂ =Â 670) have received single oral doses of 140 to 300Â mg of sumatriptan without significant adverse effects. Volunteers (NÂ =Â 174) have received single oral doses of 140 to 400Â mg without serious adverse events. Overdose of sumatriptan in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Significant naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation, or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. Because naproxen sodium may be rapidly absorbed, high and early blood levels should be anticipated. A few patients have experienced seizures, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In animals 0.5Â g/kg of activated charcoal was effective in reducing plasma levels of naproxen. Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100Â g in adults, 1 to 2Â g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4Â hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>TREXIMET is a fixed combination containing doses of sumatriptan (85Â mg) and naproxen sodium (500Â mg) within the approved dosage ranges of the individual components (25 to 100Â mg of sumatriptan and 220 to 825Â mg of naproxen sodium). TREXIMET contains a dose of sumatriptan higher than the lowest effective dose. Individuals may vary in response to doses of sumatriptan. The choice of the dose of sumatriptan, and of the use of a fixed combination such as in TREXIMET should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose of sumatriptan with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events. Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of TREXIMET and other treatment options when deciding to use TREXIMET.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The recommended dose is 1 tablet. In controlled clinical trials, single doses of TREXIMET were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults (see CLINICAL TRIALS).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The efficacy of taking a second dose has not been established. Do not take more than 2 TREXIMET tablets in 24 hours. Dosing of tablets should be at least 2Â hours apart. The safety of treating an average of more than 5 migraine headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>TREXIMET may be administered with or without food. Tablets should not be split, crushed, or chewed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The combined use of TREXIMET with MAO-A inhibitors or use of TREXIMET within 2Â weeks of discontinuation of MAO-A inhibitor therapy is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>TREXIMET and any ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) should not be used within 24Â hours of each other. TREXIMET and other 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists should not be administered within 24Â hours of each other (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>TREXIMET is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>TREXIMET is not recommended for use in patients with creatinine clearance less thanÂ 30Â mL/min (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS: Renal Effects).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dosage tested, 2Â mg/kg/day, and were present after 1Â month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; the lowest dose tested is approximately 0.8Â times the recommended human oral daily dose of 85Â mg sumatriptan on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. There was evidence of alterations in corneal appearance on the first day of intranasal dosing to dogs at all doses tested.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>TREXIMET is a prescription medicine used to treat migraine attacks in adults. It does not prevent or lessen the number of migraines you have, and it is not for other types of headaches. TREXIMET contains 2 medicines: sumatriptan and naproxen sodium (an NSAID). This Medication Guide provides important information you need to know before taking TREXIMET. It does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. </paragraph>
