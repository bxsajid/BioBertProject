                     <title>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease.
                           However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events  [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and

                        <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.

                        <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid the use of ZIPSOR in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If ZIPSOR is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.  Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic.
                           Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year.
                           However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

                        <paragraph>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a large open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2–6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks.  Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of the       3,700 patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients.  In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3–8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs.  Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of NSAID therapy. but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury.  In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more then 90 days.</paragraph>

                           study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with

                           further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use
                           for more then 90 days. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with ZIPSOR, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become
                           severe between transaminase measurements, inform patients of the warning
                           signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy,
                           diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and
                           "flu-like" symptoms), and the appropriate action patients should take if

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs.  Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [<content styleCode="italics">see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#s25">7</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid the use of ZIPSOR in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If ZIPSOR is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and,  secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly.  Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of ZIPSOR in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of ZIPSOR may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating ZIPSOR. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of ZIPSOR [<content styleCode="italics">see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#s25">7</linkHtml>)</content>]. Avoid the use of ZIPSOR in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If ZIPSOR is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Hyperkalemia</content>
                           <br/>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal  renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

                           <br/>Use of NSAIDs, including ZIPSOR, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including ZIPSOR, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ZIPSOR in pregnant women.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, and rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 1, 1, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of ZIPSOR, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#data">Data</linkHtml>]</content>. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post- implantation loss.</paragraph>

                           <br/>There are no studies on the effects of ZIPSOR during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of ZIPSOR, 100 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 2 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In rats, maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival.  Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Literature studies have shown that diclofenac has been shown to exert direct teratogenic effects on rat embryos in vitro at concentrations of 7.5 and 15 µg/mL, and diclofenac exposure to pregnant rats (1 mg/kg, IP; 0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparision) can lead to prolonged gestation as well as liver toxicity and neuronal loss in offspring.</paragraph>

                           <br/>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk; however, there is a case report in the literature indicating that diclofenac can be detected at low levels in breast milk.
                           Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ZIPSOR, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ZIPSOR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the ZIPSOR or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including ZIPSOR, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-            mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including ZIPSOR, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of ZIPSOR, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to IV administration as measured by urine recovery.  However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available.  After repeated oral administration, no accumulation of diclofenac in plasma occurred.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The extent of diclofenac absorption is not significantly affected when ZIPSOR is taken with food.  However, the rate of absorption is reduced by food, as indicated by a two-fold increase of T<sub>max</sub> and a 47% decrease in C<sub>max</sub>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin.  Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15-105 μg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid.  Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels.  It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine.  The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'- hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac.  The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity.  The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9.  Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion.  Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism.  CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy- diclofenac.  In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy-and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites.  Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine.  Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine, and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac  plus metabolites.  Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to  moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary.  The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 1 hour.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of ZIPSOR was demonstrated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel arm, multiple-dose clinical trials comparing ZIPSOR 25 mg and placebo in patients with pain following bunionectomy with osteotomy.  Once patients met the criteria for randomization (pain intensity ≥4 on a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale) they received their initial dose of study medication followed by a remedication dose when requested by the patient, and were then dosed every six hours over four days.  Pain intensity was recorded at 3 and 6 hours postdose during the fixed dosing period.  In Study 1, mean baseline pain intensity scores were 6.9 in the ZIPSOR group (range: 4 – 10) and 7.3 in the placebo group (range: 4 – 10).  In both studies, patients treated with ZIPSOR had a lower mean pain intensity score over the 48-hour inpatient period following the first remedication dose (see <linkHtml href="#f02">Figure 1</linkHtml>).  The median time to onset of pain relief was less than one hour for ZIPSOR 25 mg across the clinical trials.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The results were similar in Study 2.</paragraph>
