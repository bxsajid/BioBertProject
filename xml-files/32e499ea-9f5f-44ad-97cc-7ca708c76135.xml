Codeine in combination with butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine is a Schedule III controlled substance. As butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules contain butalbital and codeine, it exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse<content styleCode="italics"> [see <linkHtml href="#S9">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</linkHtml>]. </content>

                        <paragraph>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Assess each patient's risk for addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, and monitor all patients receiving butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids and barbiturates are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S17">Patient Counseling Information (17)</linkHtml>]</content>.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S10">Overdosage (10)</linkHtml>]</content>. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules are essential <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.1">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. Overestimating the butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Accidental ingestion of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of codeine and butalbital.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S7">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#S7">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#S17">Patient Counseling Information (17)</linkHtml>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine. Based upon postmarketing reports, children younger than 12 years old appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression. For example, many reported cases of death occurred in the post- operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to its respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. </paragraph>

All reported adverse events, except those already presented in the previous table, are included. It is important to emphasize that, although the adverse events reported did occur while the patient was receiving butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, the adverse events were not necessarily caused by butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules.</paragraph>

"Frequent" is defined as an adverse event which occurred in at least 1/100 (1%) of the patients; all adverse events listed in the previous table are frequent. "Infrequent" is defined as an adverse event that occurred in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients. All adverse events tabulated below are classified as infrequent.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.6">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</linkHtml>]</content>. Use of aspirin, including butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester). Available data with butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules n pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination of butalbital, acetaminophen, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules or with butalbital alone. In animal reproduction studies, codeine administration during organogenesis has been shown to produce delayed ossification in the offspring of mice at 2.8 times maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 180 mg/day, embryolethal and fetotoxic effects in the offspring of rats and hamsters at approximately 4 to 6 times the MRHD, and cranial malformations/ cranioschisis in the offspring of hamsters between 2 and 8 times the MRHD [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#Data">Data</linkHtml>
                                 </content>]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as aspirin, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Although butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules ware not implicated in the birth defect, a female infant was born with lissencephaly, pachygyria and heterotopic gray matter. The infant was born 8 weeks prematurely to a woman who had taken an average of 90 butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules each month from the first few days of pregnancy. The child's development was mildly delayed and from one year of age she had partial simple motor seizures.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Withdrawal seizures were reported in a two-day-old male infant whose mother had taken a butalbital containing drug during the last 2 months of pregnancy. Butalbital was found in the infant's serum. The infant was given phenobarbital 5 mg/kg, which was tapered without further seizure or other withdrawal symptoms.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Studies of aspirin use in pregnant women have not shown that aspirin increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during the first trimester of pregnancy. In controlled studies involving 41,337 pregnant women and their offspring, there was no evidence that aspirin taken during pregnancy caused stillbirth, neonatal death or reduced birth weight. In controlled studies of 50,282 pregnant women and their offspring, aspirin administration in moderate and heavy doses during the first four lunar months of pregnancy showed no teratogenic effect.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Therapeutic doses of aspirin in pregnant women close to term may cause bleeding in mother, fetus, or neonate. During the last 6 months of pregnancy, regular use of aspirin in high doses may prolong pregnancy and delivery.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>There are no studies on the effects of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including aspirin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Opioids such as codeine cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psychophysiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Aspirin should be avoided one week prior to and during labor and delivery because it can result in excessive blood loss at delivery. Prolonged gestation and prolonged labor due to prostaglandin inhibition have been reported.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Salicylates readily cross the placenta and by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, may cause constriction of ductus arteriosus resulting in pulmonary hypertension and increased fetal mortality and, possibly other untoward fetal effects. Aspirin use in pregnancy can also result in alteration in maternal and neonatal hemostasis mechanisms. Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight, increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, stillbirths and neonatal death. Use during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, should be avoided.</paragraph>

Doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg, bid resulted in fetotoxicity as demonstrated by decreased fetal body weight. In an earlier study in hamsters, single oral doses of 73 to 360 mg/kg level on Gestation Day 8 (oral; approximately 4 to 16 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis), reportedly produced cranioschisis in all of the fetuses examined.</paragraph>

                                          <paragraph>In pregnant mice, a single 100 mg/kg dose (subcutaneous; approximately 2.8 times the recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/mg<sup>2</sup> basis) administered between Gestation Day 7 and 12 reportedly resulted in delayed ossification in the offspring.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits administered up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily dose of 180 mg/day for adults on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) of codeine during organogenesis.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Codeine and its active metabolite, morphine, are present in human milk. There are published studies and cases that have reported excessive sedation, respiratory depression, and death in infants exposed to codeine via breast milk. Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine achieve higher than expected serum levels of morphine, potentially leading to higher levels of morphine in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>There is no information on the effects of the codeine on milk production.

Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including aspirin, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules contain codeine, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids, including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Barbiturates may be habit-forming. Tolerance, psychological dependence, and physical dependence may occur especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates. The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1,500 mg. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of intoxication increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than twofold. As this occurs, the margin between an intoxication dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested. Major withdrawal symptoms (convulsions and delirium) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate dependence consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. One method involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</paragraph>

Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including: irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to codeine phosphate overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to codeine overdose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of codeine in butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment consists primarily of management of barbiturate intoxication, reversal of the effects of codeine, and the correction of the acid-base imbalance due to salicylism. Vomiting should be induced mechanically or with emetics in the conscious patient. Gastric lavage may be used if the pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are present and if less than 4 hours have elapsed since ingestion. A cuffed endotracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the unconscious patient and when necessary to provide assisted respiration. Diuresis, alkalinization of the urine, and correction of electrolyte disturbances should be accomplished through administration of intravenous fluids such as1% sodium bicarbonate and 5% dextrose in water.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation. The value of vasopressor agents such as Norepinephrine or Phenylephrine Hydrochloride in treating hypotension is questionable since they increase vasoconstriction and decrease blood flow. However, if prolonged support of blood pressure is required, Norepinephrine Bitartrate (Levophed<sup>®</sup>) may be given I.V. with the usual precautions and serial blood pressure monitoring. In severe cases of intoxication, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or exchange transfusion may be lifesaving. Hypoprothrombinemia should be treated with vitamin K, intravenously.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methemoglobinemia over 30% should be treated with methylene blue by slow intravenous administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose. Typically, a dose of 0.4 to 2 mg is given parenterally and may be repeated if an adequate response is not achieved. Since the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. A narcotic antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or cardiovascular depression.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Caffeine is a methylxanthine and CNS stimulant. The exact mechanism with respect to the indication is not clear; however, the effects of caffeine may be due to antagonism of adenosine receptors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Butalbital, a barbiturate, is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that can produce sedation, respiratory depression, and euphoria. The potential impact of butalbital on painful stimuli is not clear and in some individuals barbiturates may increase reaction to painful stimuli.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Aspirin works by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandins, including prostaglandins involved in inflammation. Prostaglandins cause pain sensations by stimulating muscle contractions and dilating blood vessels throughout the body. In the CNS, aspirin works on the hypothalamus heat-regulating center to reduce fever, however, other mechanisms may be involved.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Aspirin can produce gastrointestinal injury (lesions, ulcers) through a mechanism that is not yet completely understood, but may involve a reduction in eicosanoid synthesis by the gastric mucosa. Decreased production of prostaglandins may compromise the defenses of the gastric mucosa and the activity of substances involved in tissue repair and ulcer healing.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Codeine produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope.

                              <paragraph>Aspirin affects platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting prostaglandin cyclooxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>. Nonacetylated salicylates do not inhibit this enzyme and have no effect on platelet aggregation. At somewhat higher doses, aspirin reversibly inhibits the formation of prostaglandin 12 (prostacyclin), which is an arterial vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. </paragraph>

Morphine and norcodeine are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Morphine and M6G are known to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is unknown.

                                          <paragraph>Butalbital is expected to distribute to most of the tissues in the body. Barbiturates, in general, may appear in breast milk and readily cross the placental barrier. They are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding increases directly as a function of lipid solubility.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>The <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> plasma protein binding of butalbital is 45% over the concentration range of 0.5 to 20 mcg/mL. This falls within the range of plasma protein binding (20% to 45%) reported with other barbiturates such as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital sodium. The plasma-to-blood concentration ratio was almost unity indicating that there is no preferential distribution of butalbital into either plasma or blood cells.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Evidence supporting the efficacy of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules is derived from 2 multi-clinic trials that compared patients with tension headache randomly assigned to 4 parallel treatments: butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules, codeine, butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules, USP, and placebo. Response was assessed over the course of the first 4 hours of each of 2 distinct headaches, separated by at least 24 hours butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules proved statistically significantly superior to each of its components (butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules, USP, codeine) and to placebo on measures of pain relief.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules in the treatment of multiple recurrent headaches is unavailable. Caution in this regard is required because codeine and butalbital are habit forming and potentially abusable.</paragraph>
