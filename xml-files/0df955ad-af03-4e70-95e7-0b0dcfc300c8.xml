                  <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDsof up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of seriouscardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, andstroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective,may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease orrisk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize thepotential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with anNSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortestduration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for thedevelopment of such events, even in the absence of previous CVsymptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/orsymptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigatesthe increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associatedwith NSAID use.

Patients takingthiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapieswhen taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, should beused with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP)should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatmentand throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the riskof GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected.This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest riskof this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure,liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in upto 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, including IBU tablets. These laboratoryabnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or maybe transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT orAST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal)have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trialswith NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions,including jaundice, fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepaticfailure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported. Apatient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, orwith abnormal liver test values, should be evaluated for evidence ofthe development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapywith IBU tablets. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liverdisease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g.,eosinophilia, rash, etc.), IBU tablets should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, includingIBU tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GIblood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis.Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including IBU tablets,should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibitany signs or symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreasedhemoglobin level was greater than previously reported. Decrease inhemoglobin of 1 gram or more was observed in 17.1% of 193patients on 1600 mg ibuprofen daily (osteoarthritis), and in 22.8% of189 patients taking 2400 mg of ibuprofen daily (rheumatoid arthritis).Positive stool occult blood tests and elevated serum creatinine levelswere also observed in these studies.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolongbleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect onplatelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients receiving IBU tablets who may be adversely affected byalterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disordersor patients receiving anticoagulants should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The useof aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associatedwith severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity,including bronchospasm, between aspirin and NSAIDs hasbeen reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, IBU tablets shouldnot be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivityand should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>

Although it is probablymore likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosusand related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported inpatients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs orsymptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on IBU tablets, the possibilityof its being related to IBU tablets should be considered.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, haveshown that Ibuprofen tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect-offurosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has beenattributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitanttherapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closelyfor signs of renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS, Renal Effects), aswell as to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Several short-term controlled studies failed to show that Ibuprofentablets significantly affected prothrombin times or a variety of otherclotting factors when administered to individuals on coumarin-typeanticoagulants. However, because bleeding has been reported whenIBU tablets and other NSAIDs have been administered to patients oncoumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautiouswhen administering IBU tablets to patients on anticoagulants. Theeffects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, suchthat the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleedinghigher than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring withIbuprofen tablets is gastrointestinal. In controlled clinical trials thepercentage of patients reporting one or more gastrointestinal complaintsranged from 4% to 16%.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In controlled studies when Ibuprofen tablets were compared toaspirin and indomethacin in equally effective doses, the overall incidenceof gastrointestinal complaints was about half that seen in eitherthe aspirin- or indomethacin-treated patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Adverse reactions observed during controlled clinical trials at anincidence greater than 1% are listed in the table. Those reactions listedin Column one encompass observations in approximately 3,000patients. More than 500 of these patients were treated for periods ofat least 54 weeks.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Still other reactions occurring less frequently than 1 in 100 werereported in controlled clinical trials and from marketing experience.These reactions have been divided into two categories: Column twoof the table lists reactions with therapy with Ibuprofen tablets wherethe probability of a causal relationship exists: for the reactions inColumn three, a causal relationship with Ibuprofen tablets has notbeen established.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Reported side effects were higher at doses of 3200 mg/day thanat doses of 2400 mg or less per day in clinical trials of patients withrheumatoid arthritis. The increases in incidence were slight and stillwithin the ranges reported in the table.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>OVERDOSAGE</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Approximately 11⁄2 hours after the reported ingestion of from 7 to10 Ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), a 19-month old child weighing 12 kgwas seen in the hospital emergency room, apneic and cyanotic,responding only to painful stimuli. This type of stimulus, however,was sufficient to induce respiration. Oxygen and parenteral fluidswere given; a greenish-yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomachwith no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen. Two hoursafter ingestion the child’s condition seemed stable; she still respondedonly to painful stimuli and continued to have periods of apnea lastingfrom 5 to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care andsodium bicarbonate was administered as well as infusions of dextroseand normal saline. By four hours post-ingestion she could bearoused easily, sit by herself and respond to spoken commands.Blood level of ibuprofen was 102.9 μg/mL approximately 81⁄2 hoursafter accidental ingestion. At 12 hours she appeared to be completelyrecovered.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In two other reported cases where children (each weighingapproximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae.Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 μg/mL —about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies.A 19-year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over aperiod of a few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus wasnoted. After hospitalization, parenteral hydration and three days bedrest, he recovered with no reported sequelae.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In cases of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied byvomiting or lavage, though little drug will likely be recovered if morethan an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Because the drug is acidicand is excreted in the urine, it is theoretically beneficial to administeralkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures, the useof oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption andreabsorption of Ibuprofen tablets.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of IBU tabletsand other treatment options before deciding to use IBU tablets. Usethe lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent withindividual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with IBU tablets, thedose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’sneeds.Do not exceed 3200 mg total daily dose. If gastrointestinal complaintsoccur, administer IBU tablets with meals or milk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including flare-ups ofchronic disease:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Suggested Dosage: 1200 mg-3200 mg daily (400 mg, 600 mg or800 mg tid or qid). Individual patients may show a better responseto 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlledclinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better meanresponse in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinicalbenefits to offset potential increased risk.The dose should be tailored to each patient, and may be loweredor raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiatingdrug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higherdoses of IBU tablets than do patients with osteoarthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The smallest dose of IBU tablets that yields acceptable controlshould be employed. A linear blood level dose-response relationshipexists with single doses up to 800 mg (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYfor effects of food on rate of absorption).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The availability of three tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment.In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with IBU tablets is sometimes seen in a few days to a week but most often isobserved by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has beenachieved, the patient’s dose should be reviewed and adjusted asrequired.</paragraph>
