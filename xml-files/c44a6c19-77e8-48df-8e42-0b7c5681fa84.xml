  <br/>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis generally seem to require larger doses of fenoprofen than do those with osteoarthritis. The smallest dose that yields acceptable control should be employed.
         
 
  <br/>Although improvement may be seen in a few days in many patients, an additional 2 to 3 weeks may be required to gauge the full benefits of therapy.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as fenoprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [

                           <br/>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDS. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</content>
                           <br/>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk of developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

                           <br/>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.
        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of fenoprofen in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of fenoprofen may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating fenoprofen. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of fenoprofen [

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During clinical studies for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or mild to moderate pain and studies of pharmacokinetics, complaints were compiled from a checklist of potential adverse reactions, and the following data emerged. These encompass observations in 6,786 patients, including 188 observed for at least 52 weeks. For comparison, data are also presented from complaints received from the 266 patients who received placebo in these same trials. During short-term studies for analgesia, the incidence of adverse reactions was markedly lower than that seen in longer-term studies.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Use of NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).
        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of fenoprofen in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, embryo-fetal lethality and skeletal abnormalities were noted in offspring of pregnant rabbits following oral administration of fenoprofen during organogenesis at 0.6 times the maximum human daily dose of 3200 mg/day. However, there were no major malformations noted following oral administration of fenoprofen calcium to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures up to 0.3 and 0.6 times the maximum human daily dose of 3200 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as fenoprofen, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</paragraph>

                           <br/>There are no studies on the effects of fenoprofen during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including fenoprofen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

                           <br/>Pregnant rats were treated with fenoprofen using oral doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg (0.15 times and 0.3 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 3200 mg/day based on body surface area comparison) during the period of organogenesis. No major malformations were noted and there was no evidence of maternal toxicity at these doses, however, the exposures were below the exposures that will occur in humans.
         
 
  <br/>Pregnant rabbits were treated with fenoprofen using oral doses of 50 or 100 mg/kg (0.3 times and 0.6 times the MHDD of 3200 mg/day based on body surface area comparison) during the period of organogenesis. Maternal toxicity (mortality) was noted in the high dose animals. Although no major malformations were noted, there was an increased incidence of embryo-fetal lethality and skeletal abnormalities were present at 0.6 times the MHDD.
         
 
  <br/>Pregnant rats were treated from Gestation Day 14 through Post-Natal Day 20 with oral doses of fenoprofen of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.15, or 0.3 times the MDD of 3200 mg/day based on body surface area comparison). All doses produced significant toxicity, including vaginal bleeding, prolonged parturition, increased stillbirths, and maternal deaths.
         
 
  <br/>Pregnant rats were treated from Gestation Day 6 through Gestation Day 19 and Post Partum Day 1 to 20 (excluding parturition) with an oral dose of fenoprofen of 100 mg/kg (0.3 times the MDD of 3200 mg/day based on body surface area comparison) demonstrated only a small increase in the incidence of impaired parturition despite the presence of maternal toxicity (gastrointestinal ulceration and renal toxicity).

                           <br/>In a published study, after a dose of 600 mg every 6 hours for 4 days in postpartum mothers, breastmilk fenoprofen levels were reportedly 1.6% of those in maternal plasma. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for fenoprofen and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the fenoprofen or from the underlying maternal condition.

                           <br/>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandinmediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

                        <paragraph>Fernoprofen has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of fenoprofen, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fenoprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Fenoprofen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because fenoprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Under fasting conditions, fenoprofen is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma levels of 50 mcg/L are achieved within 2 hours after oral administration of 600 mg doses. Good dose proportionality was observed between 200 and 600 mg doses in fasting male volunteers.

                           <br/>Peak plasma levels of fenoprofen in normal elderly volunteers were similar to those observed in normal young volunteers. Elderly volunteers had a mean plasma clearance of 2.2 L/hour while plasma clearance of fenoprofen in normal young volunteers ranged from 3 to 3.5 L/hour. The overall elimination rate constant, plasma half-life and ratio of renal to nonrenal clearance of fenoprofen was the same in elderly and young volunteers. The 30 to 60% decrease in plasma clearance is due to a decrease in the volume of distribution in the body.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Fenoprofen is a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory, antiarthritic drug that also possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Results in humans demonstrate that fenoprofen has both anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions. The emergence and degree of erythemic response were measured in adult male volunteers exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. The effects of fenoprofen, aspirin, and indomethacin were each compared with those of a placebo. All 3 drugs demonstrated antierythemic activity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In all patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has been evidenced by relief of pain, increase in grip strength, and reductions in joint swelling, duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). The anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has also been evidenced by increased mobility (i.e., a decrease in the number of joints having limited motion).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The use of fenoprofen in combination with gold salts or corticosteroids has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The studies, however, were inadequate in demonstrating whether further improvement is obtained by adding fenoprofen to maintenance therapy with gold salts or steroids. Whether or not fenoprofen used in conjunction with partially effective doses of a corticosteroid has a “steroid-sparing” effect is unknown.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with osteoarthritis, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of fenoprofen have been demonstrated by reduction in tenderness as a response to pressure and reductions in night pain, stiffness, swelling, and overall disease activity (as assessed by both the patient and the investigator). These effects have also been demonstrated by relief of pain with motion and at rest and increased range of motion in involved joints.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, clinical studies have shown fenoprofen to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, dyspepsia) and tinnitus occurred less frequently in patients treated with fenoprofen than in aspirin-treated patients. It is not known whether fenoprofen causes less peptic ulceration than does aspirin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with pain, the analgesic action of fenoprofen has produced a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in pain relief, improvement in total analgesia scores, and a sustained analgesic effect.</paragraph>
