                  <paragraph>Naproxen is a member of the arylacetic acid group of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. The chemical name for naproxen is 
(+)-6-Methoxy-a-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid. Naproxen has the following 
structural formula. <br/>

                  <paragraph>Naproxen is practically odourless, white to off-white crystalline substance. 
It is lipid-soluble, practically insoluble in water at low pH and freely soluble 
in water at high pH. The octanol/water partition coefficient of naproxen at pH 
7.4 is 1.6 to 1.8. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Naproxen delayed-release tablets are enteric-coated tablets containing 375 mg 
or 500 mg of naproxen and croscarmellose sodium, povidone and magnesium 
stearate. The enteric coating dispersion contains sodium hydroxide, methacrylic 
acid copolymer, talc, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, simethicone 
emulsion and purified water. The dissolution of this enteric-coated naproxen 
tablet is pH dependent with rapid dissolution above pH 6. There is no 
dissolution below pH 4.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacodynamics<paragraph>Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with 
analgesic and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of the naproxen 
anion, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be 
related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacokinetics<paragraph>Naproxen itself is rapidly and completely absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract with an <content styleCode="italics">in vivo 
</content>bioavailability of 95%. The elimination half-life of naproxen is 
unchanged across products ranging from 12 to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of 
naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days, and the degree of naproxen accumulation is 
consistent with this half-life.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Absorption<paragraph>Naproxen delayed-release tablets are designed with a pH-sensitive 
coating to provide a barrier to disintegration in the acidic environment of the 
stomach and to lose integrity in the more neutral environment of the small 
intestine. The enteric polymer coating selected for naproxen delayed-release 
tablets dissolves above pH 6. When naproxen delayed-release tablets were given 
to fasted subjects, peak plasma levels were attained about 4 to 6 hours 
following the first dose (range: 2 to 12 hours). An <content styleCode="italics">in vivo 
</content>study in man using radiolabeled naproxen delayed-release tablets 
demonstrated that naproxen delayed-release tablets dissolve primarily in the 
small intestine rather than in the stomach, so the absorption of the drug is 
delayed until the stomach is emptied. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When naproxen delayed-release tablets were given to fasted subjects (n=24) in 
a crossovers study, the following was observed after 1 week of dosing:</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>* Mean value (coefficient of variation)</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Antacid Effects:<paragraph>When naproxen delayed-release tablets were given as a single dose 
with antacid (54 mEq buffering capacity), the peak plasma levels of naproxen 
were un changed, but the time to peak was reduced (mean T<sub>max</sub> fasted 5.6 hours, mean T<sub>max</sub> with 
antacid 5 hours), although not significantly.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Food Effects:<paragraph>When naproxen delayed-release tablets were given as a single dose 
with food, peak plasma levels in most subjects were achieved in about 12 hours 
(range: 4 to 24 hours). Residence time in the small intestine until 
disintegration was independent of food intake. The presence of food prolonged 
the time the tablets remained in the stomach, time to first detectable serum 
naproxen levels, and time to maximal naproxen levels (T<sub>max</sub>), but did not affect peak naproxen levels (C<sub>max</sub>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Distribution<paragraph>Naproxen has a volume of distribution of 0.16 L/kg. At 
therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin-bound. At doses of 
naproxen greater than 500 mg/day there is less than proportional increase in 
plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma 
protein binding at higher doses (average trough C<sub>ss</sub> 36.5, 
49.2 and 56.4 mg/L with500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily doses of naproxen, 
respectively). The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women 
at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen 
concentration in plasma (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS: Nursing 
Mothers</content>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Metabolism<paragraph>Naproxen is extensively metabolised in the liver to 6-0-desmethyl 
naproxen, and both parent and metabolites do not induce metabolising enzymes. 
Both naproxen and 6-0-desmethylnaproxen are further metabolized to their 
respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Excretion<paragraph>The clearance of naproxen is 0.13 mL/min/kg. Approximately 95% of 
the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen 
(&lt;1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (&lt;1%) or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The 
plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans ranges from 12 to 17 hours. The 
corresponding half-lives of both naproxen’s metabolites and conjugates are 
shorter than 12 hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide 
closely with the rate of naproxen disappearance from the plasma. Small amounts, 
3% or less of the administered dose, are excreted in the feces. In patients with 
renal failure metabolites may accumulate (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS: Renal 
Effects</content>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Special Populations<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pediatric Patients:<paragraph>In pediatric patients aged 5 to 16 years with arthritis, plasma 
naproxen levels following a 5 mg/kg single dose of naproxen suspension (see 
<content styleCode="bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</content>) were found to be similar to 
those found in normal adults following a 500 mg dose. The terminal half-life 
appears to be similar in pediatric and adult patients. Pharmacokinetic studies 
of naproxen were not performed in pediatric patients younger than 5 years of 
age. Pharmacokinetic parameters appear to be similar following administration of 
naproxen suspension or tablets in pediatric patients. Naproxen delayed-release 
tablets have not been studied in subjects under the age of 18.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Patients:<paragraph>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of 
naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in 
the elderly, although the unbound fraction is &lt;1% of the total naproxen 
concentration. Unbound trough naproxen concentrations in elderly subjects have 
been reported to range from 0.12% to 0.19% of total naproxen concentration, 
compared with 0.05% to 0.075% in younger subjects. The clinical significance of 
this finding is unclear, although it is possible that the increase in free 
naproxen concentration could be associated with an increase in the rate of 
adverse events per a given dosage in some elderly patients.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Race:<paragraph>Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been 
studied.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Insufficiency:<paragraph>Naproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects 
with hepatic insufficiency.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Insufficiency:<paragraph>Naproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects 
with renal insufficiency. Given that naproxen, its metabolites, and conjugates 
are primarily excreted by the kidney, the potential exists for naproxen 
metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal insufficiency. Elimination of 
naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with 
moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 
mL/min)(see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</content>).</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>General Information<paragraph>Naproxen has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 
osteoarthritis, juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis and 
bursitis, and acute gout. Improvement inpatients treated for rheumatoid 
arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in 
duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by 
both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by 
a reduction in walking time. Generally, response to naproxen has not been found 
to be dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of rheumatoid arthritis. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been 
shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion 
in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking 
time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired 
by the disease. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a clinical trial comparing standard formulations of naproxen 375 mg bid 
(750 mg a day) vs 750 mg bid (1500 mg/day), 9 patients in the 750 mg group 
terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Nineteen patients in the 1500 
mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Most of these adverse 
events were gastrointestinal events. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, 
and juvenile arthritis, naproxen has been shown to be comparable to aspirin and 
indomethacin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but 
the frequency and severity of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects 
(nausea, dyspepsia, heartburn) and nervous system adverse effects (tinnitus, 
dizziness, lightheadedness) were less in naproxen-treated patients than in those 
treated with aspirin or indomethacin. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with ankylosing spondylitis, naproxen has been shown to decrease 
night pain, morning stiffness and pain at rest. In double-blind studies the drug 
was shown to be as effective as aspirin, but with fewer side effects. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with acute gout, a favorable response to naproxen was shown by 
significant clearing of inflammatory changes (eg, decrease in swelling, heat) 
within 24 to 48 hours, as well as by relief of pain and tenderness. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Naproxen has been studied in patients with mild to moderate pain secondary to 
postoperative, orthopedic, postpartum episiotomy and uterine contraction pain 
and dysmenorrhea. Onset of pain relief can begin within 1 hour in patients 
taking naproxen. Analgesic effect was shown by such measures as reduction of 
pain intensity scores, increase in pain relief scores, decrease in numbers of 
patients requiring additional analgesic medication, and delay in time to 
remedication. The analgesic effect has been found to last for up to 12 hours. 
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Naproxen may be used safely in combination with gold salts and/or 
corticosteroids; however, in controlled clinical trials, when added to the 
regimen of patients receiving corticosteroids, it did not appear to cause 
greater improvement over that seen with corticosteroids alone. Whether naproxen 
has a “steroid-sparing” effect has not been adequately studied. When added to 
the regimen of patients receiving gold salts, naproxen did result in greater 
improvement. Its use in combination with salicylates is not recommended because 
there is evidence that aspirin increases the rate of excretion of naproxen and 
data are inadequate to demonstrate that naproxen and aspirin produce greater 
improvement over that achieved with aspirin alone. In addition, as with other 
NSAIDs, the combination may result in higher frequency of adverse events than 
demonstrated for either product alone. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In <sup>51</sup>Cr blood loss and gastroscopy studies with normal 
volunteers, daily administration of 1000 mg of naproxen has been demonstrated to 
cause statistically significantly less gastric bleeding and erosion than 3250 mg 
of aspirin. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Three 6-week, double-blind, multicenter studies with naproxen delayed-release 
tablets (375 or 500 mg bid, n=385) and naproxen immediate-release tablets (375 
or 500 mg bid, n=279) were conducted comparing naproxen delayed-release tablets 
with naproxen immediate-release tablets including 355 rheumatoid arthritis and 
osteoarthritis patients who had a recent history of NSAID-related GI symptoms. 
These studies indicated that naproxen delayed-release tablets and naproxen 
immediate-release tablets showed no significant differences in efficacy or 
safety and had similar prevalence of minor GI complaints. Individual patients, 
however, may find one formulation preferable to the other. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Five hundred and fifty-three patients received naproxen delayed-release 
tablets during long-term open-label trials (mean length of treatment was 159 
days). The rates for clinically-diagnosed peptic ulcers and GI bleeds were 
similar to what has been historically reported for long-term NSAID use.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Patients<paragraph>The hepatic and renal tolerability of long-term naproxen 
administration was studied in two double-blind clinical trials involving 586 
patients. Of the patients studied, 98 patients were age 65 and older and 10 of 
the 98 patients were age 75 and older. Naproxen was administered at doses of 375 
mg twice daily or 750 mg twice daily for up to 6 months. Transient abnormalities 
of laboratory tests assessing hepatic and renal function were noted in some 
patients, although there were no differences noted in the occurrence of abnormal 
values among different age groups.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDS, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event 
inpatients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for 
the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for 
the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that 
concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic 
events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID 
does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <content styleCode="bold">Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and 
Perforation</content>). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <content styleCode="bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</content>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs, including naproxen can lead to onset of new hypertension 
or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the 
increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics 
may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Naproxen 
should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) 
should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and 
throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<paragraph>Fluid retention, edema, and peripheral edema have been observed 
in some patients taking NSAIDs. Naproxen should be used with caution in patients 
with fluid retention, hypertension, or heart failure.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, 
Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including naproxen can cause serious gastrointestinal 
(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and 
perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be 
fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without 
warning symptoms, inpatients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who 
develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper 
GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in 
approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6months, and in about 2% to 4% of 
patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of 
use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at sometime 
during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without 
risk. The utility of periodic laboratory monitoring has not been demonstrated, 
nor has it been adequately assessed. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious 
upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior 
history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs 
have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to 
patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the 
risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of 
oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, 
smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most 
spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients 
and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To 
minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an 
NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible 
duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of 
GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional 
evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should 
include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled 
out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs 
should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, hypovolemia, heart failure, 
liver dysfunction, salt depletion, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, 
and the elderly. Discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy 
is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS: </content>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Advanced Renal 
Disease</content>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies 
regarding the use of naproxen in patients with advanced renal disease. 
Therefore, treatment with naproxen is not recommended in these patients with 
advanced renal disease. If naproxen therapy must be initiated, close monitoring 
of the patient’s renal function is advisable.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients without known prior exposure to naproxen. Naproxen should not be given 
to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in 
asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who 
exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other 
NSAIDs (see <content styleCode="bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS </content>and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS: Preexisting Asthma</content>). Emergency help should be 
sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse events 
such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur 
without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the 
first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, naproxen should be 
avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen 
delayed-release tablets, and other naproxen products should not be used 
concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion. 
</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Naproxen cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat 
corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead 
to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should 
have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue 
corticosteroids and the patient should be observed closely for any evidence of 
adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of 
arthritis. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10 g or less who are to receive 
long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of naproxen in reducing fever and inflammation 
may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of 
presumed noninfectious, noninflammatory painful conditions. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because of adverse eye findings in animal studies with drugs of this class, 
it is recommended that ophthalmic studies be carried out if any change or 
disturbance in vision occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including naproxen. Hepatic abnormalities may 
be the result of hypersensitivity rather than direct toxicity. These laboratory 
abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be 
transient with continued therapy. The SGPT (ALT) test is probably the most 
sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction. Notable elevations of ALT or AST 
(approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported 
in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, 
rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant 
hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes 
have been reported. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver 
dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated 
for evidence of the development of more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy 
with naproxen. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if 
systemic manifestations occur (eg, eosinophilia, rash, etc.), naproxen should be 
discontinued. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably other diseases with decreased or 
abnormal plasma proteins (albumin) reduce the total plasma concentration of 
naproxen, but the plasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased. Caution 
is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be 
required in these patients. It is prudent to use the lowest effective 
dose.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
naproxen . This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or 
an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term 
treatment with NSAIDs, including naproxen, should have their hemoglobin or 
hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs 
inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in 
some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
naproxen who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such 
as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should 
be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen should not be 
administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be 
used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Information for Patients<paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Patients should be informed of the following 
information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the

                     <item>Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI 
or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious 
CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the 
signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of 
speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or 
symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see 
<content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Effects</content>). </item>
                     <item>Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI 
side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization 
and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of 
ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any 
indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and 
a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(eg, eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
naproxen should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Drug Interactions<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>ACE-inhibitors<paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive 
effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in 
patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Antacids and Sucralfate<paragraph>Concomitant administration of some antacids (magnesium oxide or 
aluminum hydroxide) and sucralfate can delay the absorption of naproxen</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Aspirin<paragraph>When naproxen as naproxen delayed-release tablets is administered 
with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free 
naproxen is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not 
known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of naproxen and 
naproxen sodium and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the 
potential of increased adverse effects.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cholestyramine<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of 
cholestyramine can delay the absorption of naproxen.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diuretics<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have 
shown that naproxen can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and 
thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of 
renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the 
patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see<content styleCode="bold"> WARNINGS: Renal Effects)</content>, as well as to assure diuretic 
efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Lithium<paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These 
effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by 
the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects 
should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Methotrexate<paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular 
secretion of methotrexate in an animal model. This may indicate that they could 
enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Warfarin<paragraph>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are 
synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI 
bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. No significant interactions 
have been observed in clinical studies with naproxen and coumarin-type 
anticoagulants. However, caution is advised since interactions have been seen 
with other nonsteroidal agents of this class. The free fraction of warfarin may 
increase substantially in some subjects and naproxen interferes with platelet 
function.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Other Information Concerning Drug Interactions<paragraph>Naproxen is highly bound to plasma albumin; it thus has a 
theoretical potential for interaction with other albumin-bound drugs such as 
coumarin-type anticoagulants, sulphonylureas, hydantoins, other NSAIDs, and 
aspirin. Patients simultaneously receiving naproxen and ahydantoin, sulphonamide 
or sulphonylurea should be observed for adjustment of dose if required. Naproxen 
and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce the antihypertensive 
effect of propranolol and other beta-blockers. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and 
extends its plasma half-life significantly. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Due to the gastric pH elevating effects of H2-blockers, sucralfate and 
intensive antacid therapy, concomitant administration of naproxen 
delayed-release tablets is not recommended.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction<paragraph>Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding 
time. This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined. 
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The administration of naproxen may result in increased urinary values for 
17-ketogenicsteroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its 
metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay. Although 
17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements (Porter-Silber test) do not appear to be 
artifactually altered, it is suggested that therapy with naproxen be temporarily 
discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the 
Porter-Silber test is to be used. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Naproxen may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic 
acid (5HIAA).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Carcinogenesis<paragraph>A 2-year study was performed in rats to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential of naproxen at rat doses of 8, 16, and 24 mg/kg/day (50, 100, and 150 
mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The maximum dose used was 0.28 times the systemic 
exposure to humans at the recommended dose. No evidence of tumorigenicity was 
found.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Teratogenic Effects:<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy Category C.<paragraph>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at 20 
mg/kg/day(125 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.23 times the human systemic 
exposure), rabbits at 20 mg/kg/day (220 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.27 
times the human systemic exposure), and mice at 170 mg/kg/day (510 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.28 times the human systemic exposure) with no evidence 
of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to the drug. However, animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Naproxen should be used 
in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
fetus.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nonteratogenic Effects:<paragraph>There is some evidence to suggest that when inhibitors of 
prostaglandin synthesis are used to delay preterm labor there is an increased 
risk of neonatal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus 
arteriosus and intracranial hemorrhage. Naproxen treatment given in late 
pregnancy to delay parturition has been associated with persistent pulmonary 
hypertension, renal dysfunction and abnormal prostaglandin E levels in preterm 
infants. Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on 
the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductusarteriosus), use during 
pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Labor and Delivery<paragraph>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed 
parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. Naproxen-containing products 
are not recommended in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin 
synthesis inhibitory effect, naproxen may adversely affect fetal circulation and 
inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage. 
The effects of naproxen on labor and delivery in pregnant women are 
unknown.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women 
at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen 
concentration in plasma. Because of the possible adverse effects of 
prostaglandin-inhibiting drugs on neonates, use in nursing mothers should be 
avoided.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pediatric Use<paragraph>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 
years have not been established. Pediatric dosing recommendations for juvenile 
arthritis are based on well-controlled studies (see <content styleCode="bold">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</content>). There are no adequate effectiveness or dose-response 
data for other pediatric conditions, but the experience in juvenile arthritis 
and other use experience have established that single doses of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg 
(as naproxen suspension, see <content styleCode="bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</content>), 
with total daily dose not exceeding 15 mg/kg/day, are well tolerated in 
pediatric patients over 2 years of age.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Use<paragraph>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of 
naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in 
the elderly. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment 
of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the 
elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to 
certain adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Elderly or 
debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well 
when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in 
the geriatric population (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of 
toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal 
function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to 
monitor renal function. Geriatric patients may be at a greater risk for the 
development of a form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin 
formation during administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see 
<content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</content>).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in 960 
patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are listed below. In 
general, reactions in patients treated chronically were reported 2 to 10 times 
more frequently than they were in short-term studies in the 962 patients treated 
for mild to moderate pain or for dysmenorrhea. The most frequent complaints 
reported related to the gastrointestinal tract. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A clinical study found gastrointestinal reactions to be more frequent and 
more severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking daily doses of 1500 mg 
naproxen compared to those taking 750 mg naproxen (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY</content>). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials with about 80 pediatric patients and in 
well-monitored, open-label studies with about 400 pediatric patients with 
juvenile arthritis treated with naproxen, the incidence of rash and prolonged 
bleeding times were increased, the incidence of gastrointestinal and central 
nervous system reactions were about the same, and the incidence of other 
reactions were lower in pediatric patients than in adults. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients taking naproxen in clinical trials, the most frequently reported

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Significant naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, 
dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, 
indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, 
hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, 
disorientation or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, 
acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare. 
Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, 
and may occur following an overdose. A few patients have experienced 
convulsions, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is 
not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening. The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of the drug is 543 mg/kg in rats, 1234 mg/kg in mice, 4110 
mg/kg in hamsters, and greater than 1000 mg/kg in dogs. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a 
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease 
the plasma concentration of naproxen because of the high degree of its protein 
binding. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in 
children) and/or osmotic cathartic maybe indicated in patients seen within 4 
hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, 
alkalinization of urine or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein 
binding.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen 
and other treatment options before deciding to use naproxen delayed-release 
tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with 
individual patient treatment goals (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen delayed-release

                  <paragraph>Although all naproxen-containing products circulate in the plasma as 
naproxen, they have pharmacokinetic differences that may affect onset of action. 
Because naproxen delayed-release tablets dissolves in the small intestine rather 
than in the stomach, the absorption of the drug is delayed compared to the other 
naproxen formulations (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</content>). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The recommended strategy for initiating therapy is to choose a formulation 
and a starting dose likely to be effective for the patient and then adjust the 
dosage based on observation of benefit and/or adverse events. A lower dose 
should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or in elderly 
patients (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS </content>and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content>).</paragraph>
