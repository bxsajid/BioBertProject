                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacodynamics<paragraph>Diclofenac sodium extended-release is a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and 
antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of diclofenac 
sodium extended-release, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood 
but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacokinetics<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Absorption<paragraph>Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to 
IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass 
metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see 
Table 1). When diclofenac sodium extended-release is taken with food, there is a 
delay of 1 to 2 hours in the T<sub>max</sub> and a two-fold increase 
in C<sub>max</sub> values. The extent of absorption of diclofenac, 
however, is not significantly affected by food intake.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Distribution<paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac sodium is 
1.4 L/kg. Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily 
to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range 
(0.15-105 µg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the 
joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, 
after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than 
plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in 
the effectiveness of diclofenac.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Metabolism<paragraph>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma 
and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 
4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. In patients with renal 
dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy- and 
5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after 
single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. However, 
diclofenac metabolites undergo further glucuronidation and sulfation followed by 
biliary excretion.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One diclofenac metabolite 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac has very weak pharmacologic 
activity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Excretion<paragraph>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent 
urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of 
the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the 
urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 
35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because 
renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged 
diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal 
dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is 
approximately 2 hours.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Special Populations<paragraph>Pediatric: The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium 
extended-release has not been investigated in pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Race:Pharmacokinetics differences due to race have not been identified.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Hepatic Insufficiency:Hepatic metabolism accounts for almost 100% of 
diclofenac sodium extended-release elimination, so patients with hepatic disease 
may require reduced doses of diclofenac sodium extended-release compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal Insufficiency:Diclofenac pharmacokinetics has been investigated in 
subjects with renal insufficiency. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of 
diclofenac have been detected in studies of patients with renal impairment. In 
patients with renal impairment (inulin clearance 60-90, 30-60, and &lt;30 
mL/min; N=6 in each group), AUC values and elimination rate were comparable to 
those in healthy subjects.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <linkHtml href="#A2E1487B-0A93-4248-BA82-EB443B9AA8B9">WARNINGS, GI 
Effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <linkHtml href="#AE9345C1-5F3F-45FE-A967-B8F6785477BC">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of 
pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased 
incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have 
impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including 
diclofenac sodium extended-release, should be used with caution in patients with 
hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the 
initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<paragraph>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients 
taking NSAIDs. Diclofenac sodium extended-release should be used with caution in 
patients with fluid retention or heart failure.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, 
Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release, can cause 
serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, 
ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, 
which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or 
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five 
patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is 
symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs 
occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% 
of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of 
use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time 
during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without 
risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding </content>who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. 
Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with 
NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer 
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general 
health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac 
sodium extended-release in patients with considerable dehydration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis 
and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom 
renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal 
perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, 
secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal 
decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with 
impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking 
diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies 
regarding the use of diclofenac sodium extended-release in patients with 
advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium 
extended-release is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal 
disease. If diclofenac sodium extended-release therapy must be initiated, close 
monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Elevations of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy 
with diclofenac sodium extended-release. These laboratory abnormalities may 
progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. 
Borderline elevations (i.e., less than 3 times the ULN [ULN = the upper limit of 
the normal range]) or greater elevations of transaminases occurred in about 15% 
of diclofenac-treated patients. Of the markers of hepatic function, ALT (SGPT) 
is recommended for the monitoring of liver injury.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In clinical trials, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) 
of AST (GOT) (ALT was not measured in all studies) occurred in about 2% of 
approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment. In a 
large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated for 2-6 months, 
patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again 
at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of 
patients and included marked elevations (i.e., more than 8 times the ULN) in 
about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of 
borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3-8 times the ULN), and marked 
(&gt;8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients 
receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases 
were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with 
rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before 
patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months 
of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed 
marked transaminase elevations.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been 
reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, 
but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing 
surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver 
necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver 
failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver 
transplantation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving 
long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop 
without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the 
first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical 
trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored 
within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe 
hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms 
consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), 
diclofenac sodium extended-release should be discontinued immediately.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between 
transaminase measurements, physicians should inform patients of the warning 
signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, 
pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms), 
and the appropriate action patients should take if these signs and symptoms 
appear.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients 
treated with diclofenac sodium extended-release, the lowest effective dose 
should be used for the shortest duration possible. Caution should be exercised 
in prescribing diclofenac sodium extended-release with concomitant drugs that 
are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, 
anti-epileptics).</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients without known prior exposure to diclofenac sodium extended-release 
tablets. Diclofenac sodium extended-release should not be given to patients with 
the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients 
who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, 
potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. (See <linkHtml href="#AE9345C1-5F3F-45FE-A967-B8F6785477BC">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#A43317A5-7504-4D79-873E-E4863233B3C6">PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting 
Asthma</linkHtml>.) Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid 
reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release, can cause 
serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These 
serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the 
signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be 
discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of 
hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diclofenac sodium 
extended-release should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the 
ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets cannot be expected to 
substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt 
discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on 
prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a 
decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium extended-release in 
reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic 
signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful 
conditions.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
diclofenac sodium extended-release. This may be due to fluid retention, occult 
or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. 
Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium 
extended-release, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they 
exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
diclofenac sodium extended-release who may be adversely affected by alterations 
in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients 
receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has 
been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium 
extended-release should not be administered to patients with this form of 
aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting 
asthma.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
bleeding. In patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac 
sodium extended-release, the CBC and a chemistry profile (including transaminase 
levels) should be checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
diclofenac sodium extended-release should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Drug Interactions<paragraph>Aspirin:When diclofenac sodium extended-release is administered 
with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced. The clinical significance of this 
interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant 
administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of 
the potential of increased adverse effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methotrexate<content>: </content>NSAIDs have been reported to 
competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This 
may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution 
should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Cyclosporine<content>: </content>Diclofenac sodium 
extended-release, like other NSAIDs, may affect renal prostaglandins and 
increase the toxicity of certain drugs. Therefore, concomitant therapy with 
diclofenac sodium extended-release may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity. 
Caution should be used when diclofenac sodium extended-release is administered 
concomitantly with cyclosporine.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>ACE-inhibitors:Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive 
effect of ACE inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in 
patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Furosemide:Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have 
shown that diclofenac sodium extended-release can reduce the natriuretic effect 
of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed 
to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with 
NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see 
<linkHtml href="#A629EC52-91C7-4BB2-A184-D4B271315801">WARNINGS, Renal Effects</linkHtml>), as 
well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Lithium:NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These 
effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses are usually limited to 
lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally 
reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. 
Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, 
but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic 
ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a 
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated 
charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic 
cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with 
symptoms or following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced 
diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be 
useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac 
sodium extended-release and other treatment options before deciding to use 
diclofenac sodium extended-release. Use the lowest effective dose for the 
shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <linkHtml href="#A6BE466E-13E9-4E80-97D8-6A7735407848">WARNINGS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with diclofenac sodium 
extended-release, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an 
individual patient’s needs.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the relief of osteoarthritis, the recommended dosage is 100 mg q.d.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended dosage is 100 mg q.d. 
In the rare patient where diclofenac sodium extended-release 100 mg/day is 
unsatisfactory, the dose may be increased to 100 mg b.i.d. if the benefits 
outweigh the clinical risks of increased side effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Different formulations of diclofenac (diclofenac sodium delayed-release 
tablets; diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets; diclofenac potassium 
immediate-release tablets) are not necessarily bioequivalent even if the 
milligram strength is the same.</paragraph>
