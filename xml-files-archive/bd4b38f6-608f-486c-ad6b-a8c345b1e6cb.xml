               <title>Precautions:
</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>The safe use of Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection in cats younger than 4 months of age, cats used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating queens has not been evaluated. Meloxicam is not recommended for use in cats with bleeding disorders, as safety has not been established in cats with these disorders. Safety has not been established for intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) use in cats. When administering Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection, use a syringe of appropriate size to ensure precise dosing.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>As a class, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient. Cats that have experienced adverse reactions from one NSAID may experience adverse reactions from another NSAID. NSAIDs may inhibit the prostaglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function. Such anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed. <content styleCode="bold">Patients at greatest risk for adverse events are those that are dehydrated, on concomitant diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction.</content> Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached and monitored. <content styleCode="bold">Anesthetic drugs may affect renal perfusion; approach concomitant use of anesthetics and NSAIDs cautiously. Appropriate monitoring procedures should be employed during all surgical procedures. The use of perioperative parenteral fluids is recommended to decrease potential renal complications when using NSAIDs. If additional pain medication is needed after the single one-time dose of meloxicam, a non-NSAID class of analgesic may be necessary.</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In one study<sup>1</sup>, one cat in each NSAID treatment group had increased intraoperative hemorrhage. Since NSAIDs possess the potential to induce gastrointestinal ulcerations and/or gastrointestinal perforation, concomitant use of meloxicam with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Consider appropriate washout times when switching from corticosteroid use to meloxicam in cats. <content styleCode="bold">As a single use product in cats, meloxicam should not be followed by additional NSAIDs or corticosteroids.</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The use of concomitantly protein-bound drugs with Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection has not been studied in cats. Commonly used protein-bound drugs include cardiac, anticonvulsant, and behavioral medications. The influence of concomitant drugs that may inhibit metabolism of Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection has not been evaluated. Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The effect of cyclo-oxygenase inhibition and the potential for thromboembolic occurrence or a hyper-coagulable state has not been studied.

                  <paragraph>Meloxicam has nearly 100% bioavailability after subcutaneous injection in cats. The terminal elimination half-life after a single dose is estimated to be approximately 15 hrs (+/-10%) in cats. Peak drug concentrations of 1.1 mcg/mL can be expected to occur within 1.5 hours following a 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneous injection in cats. The volume of distribution (Vdλ) in cats is approximately 0.27 L/kg, with an estimated total systemic clearance of 0.013 L/hr/kg. The drug is 97% bound to feline plasma proteins.

                           <content styleCode="bold">Cats:</content> The effectiveness of meloxicam injection was demonstrated in a masked field study involving a total of 138 cats representing various breeds. This study used butorphanol as an active control. Cats received either a single subcutaneous injection of 0.3 mg/kg meloxicam injection or 0.4 mg/kg butorphanol prior to onychectomy, either alone or in conjunction with surgical neutering. All cats were premedicated with acepromazine, induced with propofol and maintained on isoflurane. Pain assessment variables evaluated by veterinarians included additional pain intervention therapy, gait/lameness score, analgesia score, sedation score, general impression score, recovery score, and visual analog scale score. Additionally, a cumulative pain score, which was the summation of the analgesia, sedation, heart rate and respiratory rate scores was evaluated.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A palpometer was used to quantify the pain threshold.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A substantial number of cats required additional intervention in the 0-24 hour post-surgical period, with the majority of these interventions taking place within the first hour. Therefore, the percentage of cats in each group that received one or more interventions was designated as the primary assessment variable. Approximately half of the cats in each group received a pain intervention as a result of the first (time 0) post-surgical evaluation, i.e., extubation. At this point, the need to provide a pain intervention was not statistically significant between the two groups (p=0.7215). However, the median number of interventions was one per cat in the meloxicam group and two per cat in the butorphanol group and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.0021). The statistical evaluation supports the conclusion that the meloxicam test article is non-inferior to the butorphanol active control. Forty-eight of the 72 cats in the meloxicam group received one or more interventions (66.7%), and 47 of 66 cats in the butorphanol group received one or more interventions (71.2%). The number of interventions administered to the meloxicam group was less than the butorphanol group at 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 24 hours post-surgery.

                           <content styleCode="bold">Cats: 3 Day Target Animal Safety Study -</content> In a three day safety study, subcutaneous meloxicam injection administration to healthy cats at up to 1.5 mg/kg (5X the recommended dose) resulted in vomiting in three cats (1 of 6 control cats and 2 of 6 cats in 5X) and loose stools in four cats (2 of 6 control cats and 2 of 6 cats in 5X). Fecal occult blood was detected in ten of the twenty four cats, including two cats in the control group. This was not a dose-related event.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinically significant hematologic changes seen included increased PT and APTT in two cats (1 of 6 control cats and 1 of 6 cats in 5X), and elevated white blood cell counts in cats having renal or GI tract lesions. Serum chemistry changes observed included decreased total protein in four of 24 cats (1 of 6 cats in 1X, 2 of 6 cats in 3X and 1 of 6 cats in 5X), concomitant increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values in 2 of 6 cats in 5X.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Histological examination revealed gastrointestinal lesions ranging from inflammatory cell infiltration of the mucosa of the GI tract to erosions. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy was identified in 1 of 6 cats in 1X. Renal changes ranged from dilated medullary (2 of 6 cats in 1X, 1 of 6 cats in 3X, and 1 of 6 cats in 5X) and cortical (3 of 6 cats in 1X, 1 of 6 cats in 3X, and 3 of 6 cats in 5X) tubules and inflammation (2 of 6 cats in 1X, 2 of 6 cats in 3X, and 2 of 6 cats in 5X) or fibrosis (2 of 6 cats in 3X and 2 of 6 cats in 5X) of the interstitium to necrosis of the tip of the papilla (5 of 6 cats in 5X).

                           <content styleCode="bold">Subsequent oral dosing -</content> In a nine day study with three treatment groups, meloxicam injection was given as a single subcutaneous injection using doses of 0 mg/kg (saline injection), 0.3 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg on Day 0. Meloxicam oral suspension, 1.5 mg/mL or saline was then administered orally once-daily at the same respective dose (0.3 or 0.6 mg/kg) for eight consecutive days. Clinical adverse reactions included vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and decreased food consumption in the treated groups, and one day of diarrhea in one control cat. The gross necropsy report includes observation of reddened GI mucosa in 3 of 4 cats in the 0.3 mg/kg group and 1 of 4 cats in the 0.6 mg/kg group. All saline-treated cats were normal. By Day 9, one cat in both the 0.3 mg/kg group and the 0.6 mg/kg group died and another cat in the 0.3 mg/kg group was moribund. The cause of death for these cats could not be determined, although the pathologist reported pyloric/duodenal ulceration in the cats in 0.6 mg/kg group. The safety studies demonstrate a narrow margin of safety.

                  <paragraph>The safe use of Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection in dogs younger than 6 months of age, dogs used for breeding, or in pregnant or lactating bitches has not been evaluated. Meloxicam is not recommended for use in dogs with bleeding disorders, as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders. Safety has not been established for intramuscular (IM) administration in dogs. When administering Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection, use a syringe of appropriate size to ensure precise dosing. As a class, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse events varies with the individual patient. Dogs that have experienced adverse reactions from one NSAID may experience adverse reactions from another NSAID. Patients at greatest risk for renal toxicity are those that are dehydrated, on concomitant diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached. NSAIDs may inhibit the prostaglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function. Such anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Since NSAIDs possess the potential to induce gastrointestinal ulcerations and/or perforations, concomitant use with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided. If additional pain medication is needed after the administration of the total daily dose of meloxicam oral suspension, a non-NSAID or noncorticosteroid class of analgesia should be considered. The use of another NSAID is not recommended. Consider appropriate washout times when switching from corticosteroid use or from one NSAID to another in dogs. The use of concomitantly protein-bound drugs with Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection has not been studied in dogs. Commonly used protein-bound drugs include cardiac, anticonvulsant and behavioral medications. The influence of concomitant drugs that may inhibit metabolism of Loxicom 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection has not been evaluated. Drug compatibility should be monitored in patients requiring adjunctive therapy. The effect of cyclo-oxygenase inhibition and the potential for thromboembolic occurrence or a hypercoagulable state has not been studied.

                  <paragraph>Meloxicam, like other NSAIDs, is not free from adverse reactions. Owners should be advised of the potential for adverse reactions and be informed of the clinical signs associated with NSAID intolerance. Adverse reactions may include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, decreased appetite and behavioral changes.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Dog owners should be advised when their pet has received a meloxicam injection. Dog owners should contact their veterinarian immediately if possible adverse reactions are observed, and dog owners should be advised to discontinue Loxicom therapy.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Meloxicam has nearly 100% bioavailability when administered orally or after subcutaneous injection in dogs. The terminal elimination half-life after a single dose is estimated to be approximately 24 hrs (+/-30%) in dogs regardless of route of administration. Drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and total systemic clearance remain constant up to 5 times the recommended dose for use in dogs. However, there is some evidence of enhanced drug accumulation and terminal elimination half-life prolongation when dogs are dosed for 45 days or longer.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Peak drug concentrations of 0.734 mcg/mL can be expected to occur within 2.5 hours following a 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneous injection in dogs. Based upon intravenous administration in Beagle dogs, the meloxicam volume of distribution in dogs (Vdλ) is approximately 0.32 L/kg and the total systemic clearance is 0.01 L/hr/kg. The drug is 97% bound to canine plasma proteins.

Vomiting occurred in 1 of 6 dogs in the 5X group. Fecal occult blood was detected in 3 of 6 dogs in the 5X group. No clinically significant hematologic changes were seen, but serum chemistry changes were observed. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly increased in one 1X dog and two of the 5X dogs. One dog in the 5X group had a steadily increasing GGT over 4 days, although the values remained within the reference range. Decreases in total protein and albumin occurred in 2 of 6 dogs in the 3X group and 3 of 6 dogs in the 5X group. Increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) occurred in 3 of 6 dogs in the 1X group, 2 of 6 dogs in the 3X group and 2 of 6 dogs in the 5X group. Increased creatinine occurred in 2 dogs in the 5X group. Increased urine protein excretion was noted in 2 of 6 dogs in the control group, 2 of 6 dogs in the 1X group, 2 of 6 dogs in the 3X group, and 5 of 6 dogs in the 5X group. Two dogs in the 5X group developed acute renal failure by Day 4. Bicarbonate levels were at or above normal levels in 1 of the 3X dogs and 2 of the 5X dogs. Histological examination revealed gastrointestinal lesions ranging from superficial mucosal hemorrhages and congestion to erosions. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy was identified in 2 of 6 dogs in the 1X group, 4 of 6 dogs in the 3X group, and 5 of 6 dogs in the 5X group. Renal changes ranged from dilated medullary and cortical tubules and inflammation of the interstitium, to necrosis of the tip of the papilla in 2 of 6 dogs in the 1X group, 2 of 6 dogs in the 3X group, and 4 of 6 dogs in the 5X group.
