                  <paragraph>Approximately 1 1/2 hours after the reported ingestion of from 7 to 10 ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), a 19 - month old child weighing 12 kg was seen in the <br/>

                  <paragraph>Oxygen and parenteral fluids were given; a greenish - yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomach with no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two hours after ingestion the child's condition seemed stable; she still responded only ro painful stimuli and continued to have periods of apnea lasting from</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5 to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care and sodium bicarbonate was administered as well as infusions of dextrose and normal saline. By four</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>hours post - ingestion she could be aroused easily, sit by herself and respond to spoken commands. Blood level of ibuprofen was 102.9 ug / mL approxiamtely</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8 1/2 hours after accidental ingestion. As 12 hours she appeared to be completely recovered.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In two other reported cases where children (each weighing approximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately 120 mg / kg, there were no</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae. Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 ug / mL - about 10 times the peak levels seen in</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>A 19 - year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over a period of a few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus was noted. After</paragraph>
