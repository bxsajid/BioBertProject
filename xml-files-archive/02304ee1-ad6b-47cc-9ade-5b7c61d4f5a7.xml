                     <content styleCode="bold">
                        <content styleCode="italics">Hydrocodone component:</content>
                     </content> Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opioids is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, opioids may produce drowsiness, changes in mood, and mental clouding.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">
                        <content styleCode="italics">Ibuprofen component</content>
                     </content>: Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its mode of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen is a peripherally acting analgesic. Ibuprofen does not have any known effects on opiate receptors.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Pharmacokinetics:</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Absorption</content>: After oral dosing with the hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablet, a peak hydrocodone plasma level of 27 ng/mL is achieved at 1.7 hours, and a peak ibuprofen plasma level of 30 mcg/mL is achieved at 1.8 hours. The effect of food on the absorption of either component from the hydrocodone Bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets has not been established.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Distribution</content>: Ibuprofen is highly protein bound (99%) like most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone has not been definitely determined, structural similarities to related opioid analgesics suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein bound as most agents in the 5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to a similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% [oxycodone]), hydrocodone is expected to fall within this range.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism</content>: Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-α and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites. Hydromorphone, a potent opioid, is formed from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone and contributes to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone. The O- and N-demethylation processes are mediated by separate P-450 isoenzymes: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ibuprofen is present in this product as a racemate, and following absorption it undergoes interconversion in the plasma from the R-isomer to the S-isomer. Both the R- and S-isomers are metabolized to two primary metabolites: (+)-2-4’-(2hydroxy-2-methyl-propyl) phenyl propionic acid and (+)-2-4’-(2carboxypropyl) phenyl propionic acid, both of which circulate in the plasma at low levels relative to the parent.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Elimination</content>: Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys, with a mean plasma half-life of 4.5 hours. Ibuprofen is excreted in the urine, 50% to 60% as metabolites and approximately 15% as unchanged drug and conjugate. The plasma half-life is 2.2 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Special Populations</content>: No significant pharmacokinetic differences based on age or gender have been demonstrated. The pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone and ibuprofen from hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets has not been evaluated in children.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Renal Impairment</content>: The effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of the hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen dosage form has not been determined.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Abuse and Dependence:</content> Hydrocodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and therefore has the potential for being abused. Psychic and physical dependence as well as tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of this drug and it should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution as other narcotic drugs (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_abuse_dependence_id_19b4311f-3038-4c04-b641-06393bc6b472">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Respiratory Depression</content>: At high doses or in opioid-sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory centers. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure</content>: The respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Acute Abdominal Conditions</content>: The administration of opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects-Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation</content>: Serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Minor upper GI problems, such as dypsepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy. Therefore, physicians and patients should remain alert for ulceration and bleeding even in the absence of previous GI tract symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious GI toxicity and what steps to take if they occur. The utility of periodic laboratory monitoring has not been demonstrated, nor has it been adequately assessed. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event of NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Even short term therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs have been considered.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies have shown that patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding and who use NSAIDs, have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors. In addition to a past history of ulcer disease, pharmaco-epidemiological studies have identified several other co-therapies or co-morbid conditions that may increase the risk for GI bleeding such as: treatment with oral corticosteroids, treatment with anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, alcoholism, older age, and poor general health status.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Anaphylactoid Reactions</content>: Anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. The triad typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Fatal reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_431d84a3-e0dd-4a6e-8d67-d101ae3b6dbe">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#_Ref">PRECAUTIONS-Pre-existing Asthma</linkHtml>). Emergency help should be sought when anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Advanced Renal Disease</content>: In cases with advanced kidney disease, treatment with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen are not recommended. If NSAID therapy, however, must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient’s kidney function is advisable (see <linkHtml href="#_Ref">PRECAUTIONS-Renal Effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                     </content> As with any opioid analgesic agent, hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should be used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison’s disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. The usual precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind.</paragraph>

                     </content>: Hydrocodone suppresses the cough reflex; as with opioids, caution should be exercised when hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen are used postoperatively and in patients with pulmonary disease.</paragraph>

                     </content>: The antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity of ibuprofen may reduce fever and inflammation, thus diminishing their utility as diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, noninflammatory painful conditions.</paragraph>

                        <content styleCode="italics">Hepatic Effects</content>
                     </content>: As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been reported to cause borderline elevations of one or more liver enzymes, this may occur in up to 15% of patients. These abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Notable (3 times the upper limit of normal) elevations of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) occurred in controlled clinical trials in less than 1% of patients. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunctions, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of more severe hepatic reactions while on therapy with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen. Severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and cases of fatal hepatitis, have been reported with ibuprofen as with other NSAIDs. Although such reactions are rare, if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, etc.), hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                        <content styleCode="italics">Renal Effects</content>
                     </content>: Caution should be used when initiating treatment with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen in patients with considerable dehydration. It is advisable to rehydrate patients first and then start therapy with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen. Caution is also recommended in patients with pre-existing kidney disease (see <linkHtml href="#_Ref">WARNINGS-Advanced Renal Disease</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, long-term administration of ibuprofen has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal pathologic changes. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in which renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ibuprofen metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The extent to which the metabolites may accumulate in patients with renal failure has not been studied. Patients with significantly impaired renal function should be more closely monitored.</paragraph>

                     </content>: Ibuprofen, like other NSAIDs, can inhibit platelet aggregation but the effect is quantitatively less and of shorter duration than that seen with aspirin. Ibuprofen has been shown to prolong bleeding time in normal subjects. Because this prolonged bleeding effect may be exaggerated in patients with underlying hemostatic defects, hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen should be used with caution in persons with intrinsic coagulation defects and those on anticoagulant therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ibuprofen. This may be due to fluid retention, GI loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis.</paragraph>

                     </content>: Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which may be fatal. Since cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing asthma.</paragraph>

Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosous and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen, the possibility of its being related to ibuprofen should be considered</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen, like other opioid-containing analgesics, may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly. Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen may be habitforming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen, like other drugs containing ibuprofen, is not free of side effects. The side effects of these drugs can cause discomfort and, rarely, there are more serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcomes. Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding, blurred vision or other eye symptoms, skin rash, weight-gain, or edema.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen was administered to approximately 300 pain patients in a safety study that employed dosages and a duration of treatment sufficient to encompass the recommended usage (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_f7918782-5452-4cd9-9eac-989a5fa3b453">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>). Adverse event rates generally increased with increasing daily dose. The event rates reported below are from approximately 150 patients who were in a group that received one tablet of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen an average of three to four times daily. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in the trials were fairly similar for this patient group and those who received the comparison treatment, acetaminophen with 600 mg codeine 60 mg.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Abuse</content>: Psychic dependence, physical dependence, and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of opioids; therefore, hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should be prescribed and administered with the same degree of caution appropriate to use of other narcotic medications.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Dependence</content>: Physical dependence, the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome, assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of opioid therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia, is manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia. The rate of development of tolerance varies among patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>However, psychic dependence is unlikely to develop when hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are used for a short time in the treatment of acute pain.</paragraph>

                     </content>: Serious overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanis) extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur.</paragraph>

Other symptoms may include headache, dizziness, tinnitus, confusion, blurred vision, mental disturbances, skin rash, stomatitis, edema, reduced retinal sensitivity, corneal deposits, and hyperkalemia.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose or unusual sensitivity to opioids, including hydrocodone, therefore an appropriate dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered intravenously with simultaneous efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of hydrocodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug. In cases where consciousness is impaired it may be inadvisable to perform gastric lavage. If gastric lavage is performed, little drug will likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Ibuprofen is acidic and is excreted in the urine; therefore, it may be beneficial to administer alkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measure the use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen. Dialysis is not likely to be effective for removal of ibuprofen: it is very highly bound to plasma proteins.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>For the short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of acute pain, the recommended dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets is one 7.5 mg / 200 mg tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as necessary. Dosage should not exceed five 7.5 mg / 200 mg tablets in a 24-hour period. It should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. The lowest effective dose of the longest dosing interval should be sought for each patient, especially in the elderly. After observing the initial response to therapy with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen, the dose and frequency of dosing should be adjusted to suit the individual patient’s need, without exceeding the total daily dose recommended.</paragraph>
