                  <paragraph>Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, 
USP is a combination drug product intended as a treatment for tension 
headache.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP consists of a fixed 
combination of caffeine 40 mg, butalbital 50 mg, and aspirin 325 mg. The role 
each component plays in the relief of the complex of symptoms known as tension 
headache is incompletely understood.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacokinetics<paragraph>
                     <content>Bioavailability: </content>The 
bioavailability of the components of the fixed combination of Butalbital, 
Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP is identical to their 
bioavailability when Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP and codeine 
are administered separately in equivalent molar doses.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The behavior of the individual components is described below.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Aspirin<paragraph>The systemic availability of aspirin after an oral dose is highly 
dependent on the dosage form, the presence of food, the gastric emptying time, 
gastric pH, antacids, buffering agents, and particle size. These factors affect 
not necessarily the extent of absorption of total salicylates but more the 
stability of aspirin prior to absorption.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During the absorption process and after absorption, aspirin is mainly 
hydrolyzed to salicylic acid and distributed to all body tissues and fluids, 
including fetal tissues, breast milk, and the central nervous system (CNS). 
Highest concentrations are found in plasma, liver, renal cortex, heart, and 
lung. In plasma, about 50%-80% of the salicylic acid and its metabolites are 
loosely bound to plasma proteins.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The clearance of total salicylates is subject to saturable kinetics; however, 
first-order elimination kinetics are still a good approximation for doses up to 
650 mg. The plasma half-life for aspirin is about 12 minutes and for salicylic 
acid and/or total salicylates is about 3 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The elimination of therapeutic doses is through the kidneys either as 
salicylic acid or other biotransformation products. The renal clearance is 
greatly augmented by an alkaline urine as is produced by concurrent 
administration of sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The biotransformation of aspirin occurs primarily in the hepatocytes. The 
major metabolites are salicyluric acid (75%), the phenolic and acyl glucuronides 
of salicylate (15%), and gentisic and gentisuric acid (1%). The bioavailability 
of the aspirin component of Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate 
Capsules, USP is equivalent to that of a solution except for a slower rate of 
absorption. A peak concentration of 8.8 mcg/mL was obtained at 40 minutes after 
a 650 mg dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>See<content styleCode="italics">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-11.3"> OVERDOSAGE</linkHtml>
                     </content> for 
toxicity information.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Codeine<paragraph>Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It 
is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body 
tissues, with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver, 
spleen, and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is found in 
fetal tissue and breast milk. The plasma concentration does not correlate with 
brain concentration or relief of pain, however, codeine is not bound to plasma 
proteins and does not accumulate in body tissues.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The plasma half-life is about 2.9 hours. The elimination of codeine is 
primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted by the 
kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products consist of 
free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated 
norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine 
(4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose is excreted in the 
feces.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>At therapeutic doses, the analgesic effect reaches a peak within 2 hours and 
persists between 4 and 6 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The bioavailability of the codeine component of Butalbital, Aspirin, 
Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP is equivalent to that of a

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Butalbital<paragraph>Butalbital is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 
is expected to distribute to most of the tissues in the body. Barbiturates, in 
general, may appear in breast milk and readily cross the placental barrier. They 
are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree and binding 
increases directly as a function of lipid solubility.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Elimination of butalbital is primarily via the kidney (59%-88% of the dose) 
as unchanged drug or metabolites. The plasma half-life is about 35 hours. 
Urinary excretion products included parent drug (about 3.6% of the dose), 
5-isobutyl-5-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) barbituric acid (about 24% of the dose), 
5-allyl-5(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propyl) barbituric acid (about 4.8% of the dose), 
products with the barbituric acid ring hydrolyzed with excretion of urea (about 
14% of the dose), as well as unidentified materials. Of the material excreted in 
the urine, 32% was conjugated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The bioavailability of the butalbital component of Butalbital, Aspirin, 
Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP is equivalent to that of a 
solution except for a decrease in the rate of absorption. A peak concentration 
of 2,020 ng/mL is obtained at about 1.5 hours after a 100 mg dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>plasma protein binding of butalbital 
is 45% over the concentration range of 0.5-20 mcg/mL. This falls within the 
range of plasma protein binding (20%-45%) reported with other barbiturates such 
as phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and secobarbital sodium. The plasma-to-blood 
concentration ratio was almost unity indicating that there is no preferential 
distribution of butalbital into either plasma or blood cells.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Caffeine<paragraph>Like most xanthines, caffeine is rapidly absorbed and distributed 
in all body tissues and fluids, including the CNS, fetal tissues, and breast 
milk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Caffeine is cleared rapidly through metabolism and excretion in the urine. 
The plasma half-life is about 3 hours. Hepatic biotransformation prior to 
excretion results in about equal amounts of 1-methylxanthine and 1-methyluric 
acid. Of the 70% of the dose that has been recovered in the urine, only 3% was 
unchanged drug.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The bioavailability of the caffeine component Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, 
and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP is equivalent to that of a solution except 
for a slightly longer time to peak. A peak concentration of 1,660 ng/mL was 
obtained in less than an hour for an 80 mg dose.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, 
USP is indicated for the relief of the symptom complex of tension (or muscle 
contraction) headache.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Evidence supporting the efficacy of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and 
codeine phosphate capsules is derived from 2 multi-clinic trials that compared 
patients with tension headache randomly assigned to 4 parallel treatments: 
butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules; codeine; 
Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP; and placebo. Response was 
assessed over the course of the first 4 hours of each of 2 distinct headaches, 
separated by at least 24 hours. Butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine 
phosphate capsules proved statistically significantly superior to each of its 
components (Butalbital, Aspirin, and Caffeine Capsules, USP and codeine) and to 
placebo on measures of pain relief.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, 
and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP in the treatment of multiple recurrent 
headaches is unavailable. Caution in this regard is required because codeine and 
butalbital are habit-forming and potentially abusable.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers due to a 
specific CYP2D6*2x2 genotype. These individuals convert codeine into its active 
metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid 
conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at 
labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may 
experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion or shallow 
breathing.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated

Capsules, USP was not implicated in the birth defect, a female infant was born 
with lissencephaly, pachygyria and heterotopic gray matter. The infant was born 
8 weeks prematurely to a woman who had taken an average of 90 butalbital, 
aspirin, caffeine, and codeine phosphate capsules each month from the first few 
days of pregnancy. The child’s development was mildly delayed and from one year 
of age she had partial simple motor seizures.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Withdrawal seizures were reported in a two-day-old male infant whose mother 
had taken a butalbital-containing drug during the last 2 months of pregnancy. 
Butalbital was found in the infant’s serum. The infant was given phenobarbital 5 
mg/kg, which was tapered without further seizure or other withdrawal 
symptoms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies of aspirin use in pregnant women have not shown that aspirin 
increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during the first trimester 
of pregnancy. In controlled studies involving 41,337 pregnant women and their 
offspring, there was no evidence that aspirin taken during pregnancy caused 
stillbirth, neonatal death or reduced birth weight. In controlled studies of 
50,282 pregnant women and their offspring, aspirin administration in moderate 
and heavy doses during the first four lunar months of pregnancy showed no 
teratogenic effect.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at doses up to 
150 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Labor and Delivery<paragraph>Ingestion of aspirin prior to delivery may prolong delivery or 
lead to bleeding in the mother or neonate. Use of codeine during labor may lead 
to respiratory depression in the neonate.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>Aspirin, caffeine, barbiturates and codeine are excreted in 
breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing 
infants is not known. Because of potential for serious adverse reactions in 
nursing infants from Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate 
Capsules, USP, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the 
mother.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Codeine is secreted into human milk. In women with normal codeine metabolism 
(normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low 
and dose-dependent. Despite the common use of codeine products to manage 
postpartum pain, reports of adverse events in infants are rare. However, some 
women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. These women achieve 
higher-than-expected serum levels of codeine's active metabolite, morphine, 
leading to higher-than-expected levels of morphine in breast milk and 
potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants. 
Therefore, maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse 
reactions, including death, in nursing infants.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated 
at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1-10% in 
Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16-28% in North Africans, Ethiopians 
and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk 
should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and 
baby. Caution should be exercised when codeine is administered to a nursing 
woman. If a codeine containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be 
prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical 
effect. Mothers using codeine should be informed about when to seek immediate 
medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, 
such as drowsiness or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing 
difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby. Nursing mothers who are 
ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience overdose symptoms such as extreme 
sleepiness, confusion or shallow breathing. Prescribers should closely monitor 
mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine 
during breastfeeding. (See<content styleCode="italics">

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Use<paragraph>Clinical studies of butalbital, aspirin, caffeine, and codeine 
phosphate capsules did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and 
over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other 
reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between 
the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly 
patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, 
reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac 
function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Butalbital is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk 
of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal 
function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to 
monitor renal function.</paragraph>

</content>Tolerance, psychological dependence, and physical dependence may occur 
especially following prolonged use of high doses of barbiturates. The average 
daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1,500 mg. As tolerance to 
barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of 
intoxication increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase 
more than twofold. As this occurs, the margin between an intoxication dosage and 
fatal dosage becomes smaller. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if 
alcohol is also ingested. Major withdrawal symptoms (convulsions and delirium) 
may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these 
drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of 
approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate dependence consists of cautious 
and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be 
withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. One method 
involves initiating treatment at the patient’s regular dosage level and 
gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The toxic effects of acute overdosage of Butalbital, Aspirin, 
Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP are attributable mainly to the 
barbiturate and codeine components, and, to a lesser extent, aspirin. Because 
toxic effects of caffeine occur in very high dosages only, the possibility of 
significant caffeine toxicity from Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine 
Phosphate Capsules, USP overdosage is unlikely.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Treatment<paragraph>The following paragraphs describe one approach to the treatment 
of overdose with Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, 
USP. However, because strategies for the management of an overdose continually 
evolve, consultation with a regional poison control center is strongly 
encouraged.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Treatment consists primarily of management of barbiturate intoxication, 
reversal of the effects of codeine, and the correction of the acid-base 
imbalance due to salicylism. Vomiting should be induced mechanically or with 
emetics in the conscious patient. Gastric lavage may be used if the pharyngeal 
and laryngeal reflexes are present and if less than 4 hours have elapsed since 
ingestion. A cuffed endotracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage 
of the unconscious patient and when necessary to provide assisted respiration. 
Diuresis, alkalinization of the urine, and correction of electrolyte 
disturbances should be accomplished through administration of intravenous fluids 
such as 1% sodium bicarbonate and 5% dextrose in water.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary 
ventilation. The value of vasopressor agents such as Norepinephrine or 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride in treating hypotension is questionable since they 
increase vasoconstriction and decrease blood flow. However, if prolonged support 
of blood pressure is required, Norepinephrine Bitartrate (Levophed®) may be 
given I.V. with the usual precautions and serial blood pressure monitoring. In 
severe cases of intoxication, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or exchange 
transfusion may be lifesaving. Hypoprothrombinemia should be treated with 
vitamin K, intravenously.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methemoglobinemia over 30% should be treated with methylene blue by slow 
intravenous administration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse respiratory depression and coma 
associated with opioid overdose. Typically, a dose of 0.4-2 mg is given 
parenterally and may be repeated if an adequate response is not achieved. Since 
the duration of action of codeine may exceed that of the antagonist, the patient 
should be kept under continued surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist 
should be administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. A narcotic 
antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant 
respiratory or cardiovascular depression.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose can be obtained from a 
Certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of Certified 
Regional Poison Control Centers are listed in the Physicians’ Desk 
Reference®.</paragraph>
