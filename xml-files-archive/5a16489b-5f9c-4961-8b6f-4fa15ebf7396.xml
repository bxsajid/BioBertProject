                           </content>Hydrocodone is a full opioid agonist with relative selectivity for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydrocodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with hydrocodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Ibuprofen concentrations reached during therapy have produced <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ibuprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a healthy volunteer study, ibuprofen 400 mg given once daily, administered 2 hours prior to immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) for 6 days, showed an interaction with the  antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) inhibition at 24 hours following the day-6 aspirin dose [53%]. An interaction was still observed, but minimized, when ibuprofen 400 mg given once-daily was administered as early as 8 hours prior to the immediate-release aspirin dose [90.7%]. However, there was no interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin when ibuprofen 400 mg, given once daily, was administered 2 hours after (but not concomitantly, 15 min, or 30 min after) the immediate-release aspirin dose [99.2%]. </paragraph>

                           </content>Ibuprofen is highly protein-bound (99%) like most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone in human plasma has not been definitely determined, structural similarities to related opioid analgesics suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein bound. As most agents in the 5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to a similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% [oxycodone]), hydrocodone is expected to fall within this range.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In single-dose studies of post surgical pain (abdominal, gynecological, orthopedic), 940 patients were studied at doses of one or two tablets. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets produced greater efficacy than placebo and each of its individual components given at the same dose. No advantage was demonstrated for the two-tablet dose.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, and monitor all patients receiving hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioid-containing products such as hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets.

                              <paragraph>Prolonged use of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_689b94f1-b3f4-4efa-87a6-1152db961bf2">PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_711e75f2-80ec-4016-945b-38efd57f68cb">Information for Patients</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_d26b39f6-5011-4275-afc8-7cabe0d23bbe">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined.

                              <paragraph>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ibuprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_c35f563b-b8eb-46bb-99f9-d276018041f4">WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>

In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks gestation (third trimester). Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_e54b27fc-a8db-49e6-aa32-2297acb7b6d9">WARNINGS: Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</linkHtml>)</content>. There are no available data with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, an increase in the percentage of litters and fetuses with any major abnormality and an increase in the number of litters and fetuses with one or more nonossified metacarpals was observed when the combination of hydrocodone and ibuprofen was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at 1.8 times the maximum daily dose. There are no animal reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with hydrocodone alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In published animal reproduction studies testing ibuprofen alone, there were no clear developmental effects at doses up to 1.2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in the rabbit and 1.8 times in the MRHD rat when dosed throughout gestation. In contrast, an increase in membranous ventricular septal defects was reported in rats treated on Gestation Days 9 &amp; 10 with 3 times the MRHD. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as ibuprofen, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss (<content styleCode="italics">see Data</content>). Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets are not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, can prolong labor through actions that temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>

                           </content>Pregnant rabbits were treated with 10, 33, or 95 mg/kg of 1:27 ratio of hydrocodone:ibuprofen (the high dose is 1.8 times the maximum daily dose of both compounds based on surface area) from Gestation Day 5 to 18. The dose of 95 mg/kg of the combination, which also produced maternal toxicity (44% decrease in body weight gain compared to control), resulted in an increase in the percentage of litters and fetuses with any major abnormality and an increase in the number of litters and fetuses with one or more nonossified metacarpals (a minor abnormality).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pregnant rats were treated with 50, 100, or 166 mg/kg of a 1:27 ratio of hydrocodone:ibuprofen (the high dose is 1.6 times the maximum daily dose of both compounds based on body surface area) from Gestation Day 5 to 15. No reproductive toxicity was noted despite the presence of maternal toxicity in the 100 and 166 mg/kg groups (21% and 60% decrease in body weight gain compared to control).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a published study, female rabbits given 7.5, 20, or 60 mg/kg ibuprofen (0.15, 0.39, or 1.2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1000 mg of ibuprofen based on body surface area) from Gestation Days 1 to 29, no clear treatment-related adverse developmental effects were noted. This dose was associated with significant maternal toxicity (stomach ulcers, gastric lesions). In the same publication, female rats were administered 7.5, 20, 60, 180 mg/kg ibuprofen (0.07, 0.2, 0.6, 1.8 times the maximum daily dose) did not result in clear adverse developmental effects. Maternal toxicity (gastrointestinal lesions) was noted at 20 mg/kg and above.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a published study, rats were orally dosed with 300 mg/kg ibuprofen (3 times the maximum human daily dose of 1000 mg based on body surface area) during Gestation Days 9 and 10 (critical time points for heart development in rats). Ibuprofen treatment resulted in an increase in the incidence of membranous ventricular septal defects. This dose was associated with significant maternal toxicity including gastrointestinal toxicity (1 out of 20 animals). In the same study/publication rabbits were dosed on Gestation Day 9, 10 and 11 with 500 mg/kg (9.7 times the maximum human daily dose), and only one incidence each of a membranous ventricular septal defect and gastroschisis was noted in the rabbit fetuses. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity.</paragraph>

                           </content>Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Limited published literature reports that, following oral administration, ibuprofen is present in human milk at relative infant doses of 0.06% to 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lactation studies have not been conducted with hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials there was no difference in tolerability between patients &lt; 65 years of age and those ≥ 65, apart from an increased tendency of the elderly to develop constipation. However, elderly patients are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and renal adverse reactions as well as possible increased risk of respiratory depression with opioids. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_98b7bef8-41f3-4a41-b0bc-3b9e0594819c">WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_c35f563b-b8eb-46bb-99f9-d276018041f4">Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_bb183a1b-c23c-408e-9f0c-89c6a7e567f6">Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_65c39b23-d4cf-4bc5-bcfb-5ad5ac171c60">WARNINGS: Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Both hydrocodone and ibuprofen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets contains hydrocodone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_d76f969d-babf-4758-91c0-f693c00d9651">WARNINGS: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>“Drug seeking” behavior is very common with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> When discontinuing Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <content styleCode="italics">[see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In case of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydrocodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydrocodone overdose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydrocodone, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re­-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdose (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>For the short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of acute pain, the recommended dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets is one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as necessary. Dosage should not exceed 5 tablets in a 24-hour period.

                        <paragraph>Individually titrate hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_d76f969d-babf-4758-91c0-f693c00d9651">WARNINGS: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</linkHtml>)</content>.

tablets</content>
                     </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.<br/>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on  hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <content styleCode="italics">[see WARNINGS/Withdrawal, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE]</content>.</paragraph>
