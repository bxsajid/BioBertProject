                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three yearsâ duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID increases the risk of serious GI events [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#MN052">5.2</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [<content styleCode="italics">see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#MN040">4</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â NSAIDs, including CAMBIA, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events such as inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, thus increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Prescribe NSAIDs, including CAMBIA, with extreme caution in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during CAMBIA therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the CAMBIA until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternative therapies that do not include NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Elevations of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy with CAMBIA. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may persist, or may only be transient with continued therapy. Borderline elevations (less than 3 times the upper limit of the normal [ULN] range) or greater elevations of transaminases occurred in about 15% of diclofenac-treated patients. Of the markers of hepatic function, ALT (SGPT) is recommended for the monitoring of liver injury.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â In clinical trials, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In an open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated for 2â6 months, patients were monitored at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of the 3,700 patients and included marked elevations (&gt;8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In this open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3â8 times the ULN), and marked (&gt;8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of NSAID therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Measure transaminases (ALT and AST) periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), discontinue CAMBIA immediately.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between transaminase measurements, inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and âflu-likeâ symptoms), and the appropriate action patients should take if these signs and symptoms appear.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with CAMBIA, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing CAMBIA with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, certain antibiotics, antiepileptics). Caution patients to avoid taking nonprescription acetaminophen-containing products while using CAMBIA.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Use caution when initiating treatment with CAMBIA in patients with considerable dehydration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics or ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of CAMBIA in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with CAMBIA is not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease. If CAMBIA therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patientâs renal function is advisable.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â The safety of a single dose of CAMBIA was evaluated in 2 placebo-controlled trials with a total of 634 migraine patients treated with CAMBIA for a single migraine headache. Following treatment with diclofenac potassium (either CAMBIA or diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets [as a control]), 5 subjects (0.8%) withdrew from the studies; following placebo exposure, 1 subject (0.2%) withdrew. No withdrawals were due to a serious reaction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â The most common adverse reactions (i.e., that occurred in 1% or more of CAMBIA-treated patients) and more frequent with CAMBIA than with placebo were nausea and dizziness (see <linkHtml href="#table1">Table 1</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that diclofenac potassium can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, observe patients closely for signs of renal failure as well as to assure diuretic efficacy [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#MN056">5.6</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â NSAIDs have produced elevations of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. When CAMBIA and lithium are administered concurrently, observe patients carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â <content styleCode="underline">Absorption:</content> Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to intravenous administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available. In fasting volunteers, measurable plasma levels were observed within 5 minutes of dosing with CAMBIA. Peak plasma levels were achieved at approximately 0.25 hour in fasting normal volunteers, with a range of 0.17 to 0.67 hours. High fat food had no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption, but there was a reduction in peak plasma levels of approximately 70% after a high fat meal. Decreased Cmax may be associated to decreased effectiveness.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â <content styleCode="underline">Distribution:</content> The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac potassium is 1.3 L/kg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15-105 Î¼g/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism:</content> Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4â-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3â-hydroxy-, 4â,5-dihydroxy- and 3â-hydroxy-4â-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4â-hydroxydiclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4â-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3â-hydroxy- diclofenac. In patients with renal impairment, peak concentrations of metabolites 4â-hydroxy-and 5- hydroxydiclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â <content styleCode="underline">Excretion:</content> Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â The efficacy of CAMBIA in the acute treatment of migraine headache was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Â Â Â Â Â Â Patients enrolled in these two trials were predominantly female (85%) and white (86%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65). Patients were instructed to treat a migraine of moderate to severe pain with 1 dose of study medication. Patients evaluated their headache pain 2 hours later. Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also evaluated. In addition, the proportion of patients who were âsustained pain freeâ, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to no pain at 2 hours post-dose without a return of mild, moderate, or severe pain and no use of rescue medication for 24 hours post-dose, was also evaluated. In these studies, the percentage of patients achieving pain freedom 2 hours after treatment and sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours post-dose was significantly greater in patients who received CAMBIA compared with those who received placebo (see <linkHtml href="#table2">Table 2</linkHtml>). The percentage of patients achieving pain relief 2 hours after treatment (defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain) was also significantly greater in patients who received CAMBIA compared with those who received placebo (see <linkHtml href="#table2">Table 2</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
