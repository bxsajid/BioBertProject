                  </content>In dose 
proportionality studies utilizing 600, 1200 and 1800 mg doses, the 
pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin in healthy subjects demonstrated nonlinear 
kinetics of both the total and unbound drug in opposite directions, i.e., dose 
exposure related increase in the clearance of total drug and decrease in the 
clearance of the unbound drug. Decreased clearance of the unbound drug was 
related predominantly to a decrease in the volume of distribution and not an 
increase in the half-life. This phenomenon is considered to have minimal impact 
on drug accumulation upon multiple dosing. <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of total oxaprozin is 
approximately 11-17 L/70 kg. Oxaprozin is 99% bound to plasma proteins, 
primarily to albumin. At therapeutic drug concentrations, the plasma protein 
binding of oxaprozin is saturable, resulting in a higher proportion of the free 
drug as the total drug concentration is increased. With increases in single 
doses or following repetitive once-daily dosing, the apparent volume of 
distribution and clearance of total drug increased, while that of unbound drug 
decreased due to the effects of nonlinear protein binding. Oxaprozin penetrates 
into synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients with oxaprozin 
concentrations 2-fold and 3-fold greater than in plasma and synovial fluid, 
respectively. Oxaprozin is expected to be excreted in human milk based on its 
physical-chemical properties, however, the amount of oxaprozin excreted in 
breast milk has not been evaluated.</paragraph>

Biliary excretion of unchanged oxaprozin is a minor pathway, and enterohepatic 
recycling of oxaprozin is insignificant. Upon chronic dosing the accumulation 
half-life is approximately 22 hours. The elimination half-life is approximately 
twice the accumulation half-life due to increased binding and decreased 
clearance at lower concentrations.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold"/>Oxaprozin was evaluated for managing the 
signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in placebo and active controlled 
clinical trials in a total of 646 patients. Oxaprozin was given in single or 
divided daily doses of 600 to 1800 mg/day and was found to be comparable to 2600 
to 3900 mg/day of aspirin. At these doses there was a trend (over all trials) 
for oxaprozin to be more effective and cause fewer gastrointestinal side effects 
than aspirin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin was given as a once-a-day dose of 1200 mg in most of the clinical 
trials, but larger doses (up to 26 mg/kg or 1800 mg/day) were used in selected

                     <content styleCode="bold">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</content>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up 
to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular 
(CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. 
All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. 
Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater 
risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <linkHtml href="#section-8.2">GI WARNINGS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <linkHtml href="#section-7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Hypertension</content>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>NSAIDs including oxaprozin, can 
lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, 
either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients 
taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies 
when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, should be used with caution in 
patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely 
during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of 
therapy.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. 
Oxaprozin should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart 
failure.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects-Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and 
Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause serious gastrointestinal 
(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and 
perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be 
fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without 
warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, 
who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. 
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in 
approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of 
patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of 
use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time 
during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without 
risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding </content>who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk 
factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated 
with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, 
longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor 
general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in 
elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in 
treating this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. 
This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse 
event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not 
involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in 
the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. 
Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Advanced renal disease</content>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>No information is 
available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of oxaprozin in 
patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with oxaprozin is not 
recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If oxaprozin therapy 
must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is 
advisable.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Anaphylactoid reactions</content>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>As with other NSAIDs, 
anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to 
oxaprozin. Oxaprozin should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. 
This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience 
rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal 
bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see <linkHtml href="#section-7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#section-9.1.3">PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting asthma</linkHtml>). Emergency help 
should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. <br/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause serious skin adverse 
events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur 
without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and use of drug should be discontinued at the first 
appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, oxaprozin should be 
avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Oxaprozin cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or 
to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids 
may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy 
should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue 
corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of oxaprozin in reducing fever and inflammation 
may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of 
presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including oxaprozin. These laboratory 
abnormalities may progress, remain unchanged, or may be transient with continued 
therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the 
upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in 
clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic 
reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminate hepatitis, liver necrosis and 
hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with oxaprozin. 
If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if 
systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), oxaprozin should 
be discontinued.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
oxaprozin. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or 
an incompletely described effect upon erythrogenesis. Patients on long-term 
treatment with oxaprozin should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit values 
determined if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
oxaprozin who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, 
such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, 
should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pre-existing asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
the severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has 
been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, oxaprozin should not be 
administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be 
used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma. </paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of GI 
bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and 
a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g. eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
oxaprozin should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant administration of oxaprozin and aspirin is not recommended 
because oxaprozin displaces salicylates from plasma protein binding sites. 
Coadministration would be expected to increase the risk of salicylate toxicity. 
As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of oxaprozin and aspirin is not 
generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects.

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation 
in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity 
of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered 
concomitantly with methotrexate. Coadministration of oxaprozin with methotrexate 
results in approximately a 36% reduction in apparent oral clearance of 
methotrexate. A reduction in methotrexate dosage may be considered due to the 
potential for increased methotrexate toxicity associated with the increased 
exposure. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of 
ACE-inhibitors. Oxaprozin has been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
enalapril (significant decrease in dose-adjusted AUC<sub>0-24</sub> 
and C<sub>max</sub>) and its active metabolite enalaprilat 
(significant increase in dose-adjusted AUC<sub>0-24</sub>). This 
interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs 
concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that 
oxaprozin can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some 
patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin 
synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be 
observed closely for signs of renal failure (see <linkHtml href="#section-8.3">WARNINGS, Renal effects</linkHtml>), as well as to assure diuretic 
efficacy. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin like other NSAIDs has produced an elevation of plasma lithium 
levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium 
concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by 
approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal 
prostaglandin synthesis by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Thus, when 
NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed 
carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. </paragraph>

coadministration of oxaprozin to type II non-insulin dependent diabetic patients 
did not affect the area under the glucose concentration curve nor the magnitude 
or duration of control. However, it is advisable to monitor patients' blood 
glucose in the beginning phase of glyburide and oxaprozin cotherapy. </paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Test Interactions<paragraph>False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for 
benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking oxaprozin. This is due to 
lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be 
expected for several days following discontinuation of oxaprozin therapy. 
Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will 
distinguish oxaprozin from benzodiazepines.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
Fertility<paragraph>In oncogenicity studies, oxaprozin administration for 2 years was 
associated with the exacerbation of liver neoplasms (hepatic adenomas and 
carcinomas) in male CD mice, but not in female CD mice or rats. The significance 
of this species-specific finding to man is unknown. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin did not display mutagenic potential. Results from the Ames test, 
forward mutation in yeast and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, DNA repair 
testing in CHO cells, micronucleus testing in mouse bone marrow, chromosomal 
aberration testing in human lymphocytes, and cell transformation testing in 
mouse fibroblast all showed no evidence of genetic toxicity or cell-transforming 
ability.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin administration was not associated with impairment of fertility in 
male and female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (1180 mg/m<sup>2</sup>); the usual human dose is 17 mg/kg/day (629 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). However, testicular degeneration was observed in beagle 
dogs treated with 37.5 to 150 mg/kg/day (750 to 3000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) of oxaprozin for 6 months, or 37.5 mg/kg/day for 42 days, a 
finding not confirmed in other species. The clinical relevance of this finding 
is not known.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Teratogenic effects—Pregnancy Category C<paragraph>Teratology studies with oxaprozin were performed in mice, rats, 
and rabbits. In mice and rats, no drug-related developmental abnormalities were 
observed at 50 to 200 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (225 to 900 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). However, in rabbits, infrequent malformed fetuses were 
observed in dams treated with 7.5 to 30 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (the usual human 
dosage range). Animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human 
response. There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 
Oxaprozin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify 
the potential risks to the fetus. </paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nonteratogenic effects<paragraph>Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use 
during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Labor and delivery<paragraph>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed 
parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of oxaprozin on 
labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing mothers<paragraph>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk; 
however, oxaprozin was found in the milk of lactating rats. Because many drugs 
are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in nursing infants from oxaprozin, a decision should be made whether 
to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the 
importance of the drug to the mother. </paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pediatric use<paragraph>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 
years of age have not been established. The effectiveness of oxaprozin for the 
treatment of the signs and symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in 
pediatric patients aged 6-16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and 
well controlled studies in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, and is based on 
an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of oxaprozin in adults with 
rheumatoid arthritis and the similarity in the course of the disease and the 
drug's mechanism of effect between these two patient populations. Use of 
oxaprozin in JRA patients 6-16 years of age is also supported by the following 
pediatric studies.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of oxaprozin were assessed in 
JRA patients relative to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients in a 14 day 
multiple dose pharmacokinetic study. Apparent clearance of unbound oxaprozin in 
JRA patients was reduced compared to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, but 
this reduction could be accounted for by differences in body weight (see <linkHtml href="#section-4.2">Pharmacokinetics</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#section-4.3">Pediatric 
patients</linkHtml>). No pharmacokinetic data are available for pediatric patients 
under 6 years. Adverse events were reported by approximately 45% of JRA patients 
versus an approximate 30% incidence of adverse events in the adult rheumatoid 
arthritis patient cohort. Most of the adverse events were related to the 
gastrointestinal tract and were mild to moderate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a 3 month open label study, 10-20 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin were administered 
to 59 JRA patients. Adverse events were reported by 58% of JRA patients. Most of 
those reported were generally mild to moderate, tolerated by the patients, and 
did not interfere with continuing treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the 
most frequently reported adverse effects and occurred at a higher incidence than 
those historically seen in controlled studies in adults. Fifty-two patients 
completed 3 months of treatment with a mean daily dose of 20 mg/kg. Of 30 
patients who continued treatment (19-48 week range total treatment duration), 
nine (30%) experienced rash on sun-exposed areas of the skin and 5 of those 
discontinued treatment. Controlled clinical trials with oxaprozin in pediatric 
patients have not been conducted.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric use<paragraph>No adjustment of the dose of oxaprozin is necessary in the 
elderly for <content styleCode="italics">pharmacokinetic </content>reasons, although many 
elderly may need to receive a reduced dose because of low body weight or 
disorders associated with aging. No significant differences in the 
pharmacokinetic profile for oxaprozin were seen in studies in the healthy 
elderly (see <linkHtml href="#section-4.3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special 
populations</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Of the total number of subjects evaluated in four placebo controlled clinical 
studies of oxaprozin, 39% were 65 and over, and 11 % were 75 and over. No 
overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these 
subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not 
identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, 
but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although selected elderly patients in controlled clinical trials tolerated as 
well as younger patients, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly, 
and extra care should be taken when choosing a dose. As with any NSAID, the 
elderly are likely to tolerate adverse reactions less well than younger 
patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic 
reactions to oxaprozin may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care 
should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal 
function (see <linkHtml href="#section-8.3">WARNINGS, Renal effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>No patient experienced either an accidental or intentional 
overdosage of oxaprozin in the clinical trials of the drug. Symptoms following 
acute overdose with other NSAIDs are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, 
nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain and are generally reversible with 
supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding and coma have occurred following 
NSAID overdose. Hypertension, acute renal failure, and respiratory depression 
are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion 
of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an 
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Gut decontamination may be 
indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or 
following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). This should be 
accomplished via emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 
g/kg in children) with an osmotic cathartic. Forced diuresis, alkalization of 
the urine, or hemoperfusion would probably not be useful due to the high degree 
of protein binding of oxaprozin.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Individualization of dosage: </content>As with other NSAIDs, 
the lowest dose should be sought for each patient. Therefore, after observing 
the response to initial therapy with oxaprozin tablet, USP, the dose and 
frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. In 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the 
dosage should be individualized to the lowest effective dose of oxaprozin 
tablet, USP to minimize adverse effects. The <content styleCode="bold">maximum</content> 
recommended total daily dose of oxaprozin tablet, USP in adults is 1800 mg (26 
mg/kg, whichever is <content styleCode="italics">lower) </content>in divided doses. In 
children, doses greater than 1200 mg have not been studied.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients of low body weight should initiate therapy with 600 mg once 
daily.<content styleCode="bold"/>Patients with severe renal impairment or on 
dialysis should also initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily. If there is 
insufficient relief of symptoms in such patients, the dose may be cautiously 
increased to 1200 mg, but only with close monitoring (see <linkHtml href="#section-4.3">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special populations</linkHtml>). In adults, 
in cases where a quick onset of action is important, the pharmacokinetics of 
oxaprozin allow therapy to be started with a one-time loading dose of 1200 to 
1800 mg (not to exceed 26 mg/kg). Doses larger than 1200 mg/day on a chronic 
basis should be reserved for patients who weigh more than 50 kg, have normal 
renal and hepatic function, are at low risk of peptic ulcer, and whose severity 
of disease justifies maximal therapy. Physicians should ensure that patients are 
tolerating doses in the 600 to 1200 mg/day range without gastroenterologic, 
renal, hepatic, or dermatologic adverse effects before advancing to the larger 
doses. Most patients will tolerate once-a-day dosing with oxaprozin tablet, USP, 
although divided doses may be tried in patients unable to tolerate single doses.</paragraph>
