                     </content>Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist with relative selectivity for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can interact with other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="underline">Ibuprofen component<br/>
                     </content>Ibuprofen has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mechanism of action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Ibuprofen concentrations reached during therapy have produced <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ibuprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers.

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings).

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</paragraph>

Two studies involving a total of 949 patients following dental surgery (removal of ipsilateral molars) and a third study of 456 patients following abdominal/pelvic surgery were conducted. In the three studies patients were administered a single dose of the Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets, ibuprofen alone, oxycodone hydrochloride alone or placebo for acute, moderate to severe pain.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In these single dose studies, oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen combination product produced greater efficacy than placebo and each of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets individual components as measured by the magnitude of pain relief and the reduction in pain intensity through six hours. No multiple dose efficacy studies have been performed with oxycodone hydrochloride and ibuprofen.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ibuprofen tablets, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <content styleCode="italics">[see <content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Starting at 30 weeks gestation, Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets, and other NSAIDs, should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur. Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman starting at 30 weeks gestation. If Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets, and other NSAIDs, are used during this time period in pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Prior to 30 weeks gestation, Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Animal studies to assess the potential effects of the combination of oxycodone and ibuprofen on embryo-fetal development were conducted in the rat and rabbit model.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Pregnant rats were treated by oral gavage with combination doses of oxycodone:ibuprofen mg/kg/day (0.25:20, 0.5:40, 1:80, or 2:160) on days 7 to 16 of gestation. There was no evidence for developmental toxicity or teratogenicity at any dose, although maternal toxicity was noted at doses of 0.5:40 and above. The highest dose tested in the rat (2:160 mg/kg/day) is equivalent to the maximum recommended human daily dose (20:1600 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. This dose was associated with maternal toxicity (death, clinical signs, decreased BW).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Pregnant rabbits were treated by oral gavage with combination doses of oxycodone:ibuprofen (0.38:30, 0.75:60, 1.5:120 or 3:240 mg/kg/day) on gestation days 7 to 19. Oxycodone:ibuprofen treatment was not teratogenic under the conditions of the assay. Maternal toxicity was noted at doses of 1.5:120 (reduced body weight and food consumption) and 3:240 mg/kg/day (mortality). The NOAEL for maternal toxicity, 0.75:60 mg/kg/day, is 0.75 fold the proposed maximum daily human dose based upon the body surface area. Developmental toxicity, as evidenced by delayed ossification and reduced fetal body weights, was noted at the highest dose, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD on an mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, and is likely due to maternal toxicity. The fetal no adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 1.50:120 mg/kg/day is approximately 1.5 times the MRHD on an mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a pre- and post-natal development study conducted in rats, there was increased mortality of pups born to dams dosed with 0.5:40 mg/kg/day oxycodone:ibuprofen and above which is equivalent to 0.25 times of the MRHD (20:1600 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. There was an increase in stillborn F1 pups and decrease in mean pup weight in dams dosed with 1:80 mg/kg/day oxycodone:ibuprofen, which is 0.5 times the MRHD (20:1600 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including oxycodone, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets should not be used during the third trimester of pregnancy due to the potential for ibuprofen to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase which may prolong pregnancy and inhibit labor. Oxycodone is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery because oral opioids may cause respiratory depression in the newborn.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</paragraph>

                        </content>]</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="underline">Risks Specific to Abuse of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets are for oral use only. Abuse of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets with alcohol and central nervous system depressants.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Dependence</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When discontinuing Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <content styleCode="italics">[see <content styleCode="bold">

                  <paragraph>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Ibuprofen Tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <content styleCode="italics">[see <content styleCode="bold">
