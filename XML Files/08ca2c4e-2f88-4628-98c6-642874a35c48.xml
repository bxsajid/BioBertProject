               <text>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) 
that exhibits antipyretic and analgesic properties. Its mode of action, like 
that of other anti-inflammatory drugs, is not known. However, its therapeutic 
action is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <content styleCode="italics">in vitro.</content> Concentrations are reached during therapy which 
have been demonstrated to have an effect <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> as 
well. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of 
bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Moreover, prostaglandins are known 
to be among the mediators of inflammation. Since indomethacin is an inhibitor of 
prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of 
prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, 
appropriate for long-term use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, 
and osteoarthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin affords relief of symptoms; it does not alter the progressive 
course of the underlying disease.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin suppresses inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis as demonstrated 
by relief of pain, and reduction of fever, swelling and tenderness. Improvement 
in patients treated with indomethacin for rheumatoid arthritis has been 
demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, average number of joints 
involved, and morning stiffness; by increased mobility as demonstrated by a 
decrease in walking time; and by improved functional capability as demonstrated 
by an increase in grip strength. Indomethacin may enable the reduction of 
steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more severe forms of 
rheumatoid arthritis. In such instances the steroid dosage should be reduced 
slowly and the patients followed very closely for any possible adverse 
effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin has been reported to diminish basal and CO<sub>2</sub> stimulated cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers 
following acute oral and intravenous administration. In one study after one week 
of treatment with orally administered indomethacin, this effect on basal 
cerebral blood flow had disappeared. The clinical significance of this effect 
has not been established.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin capsules have been found effective in relieving the pain, 
reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis 
(see <content styleCode="bold">

USAGE</linkHtml>
                     </content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following single oral doses of indomethacin capsules 25 mg or 50 mg, 
indomethacin is readily absorbed, attaining peak plasma concentrations of about 
1 and 2 mcg/mL, respectively, at about 2 hours. Orally administered indomethacin 
capsules are virtually 100% bioavailable, with 90% of the dose absorbed within 4 
hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is eliminated via renal excretion, metabolism, and biliary 
excretion. Indomethacin undergoes appreciable enterohepatic circulation. The 
mean half-life of indomethacin is estimated to be about 4.5 hours. With a 
typical therapeutic regimen of 25 or 50 mg t.i.d., the steady-state plasma 
concentrations of indomethacin are an average 1.4 times those following the 
first dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin exists in the plasma as the parent drug and its desmethyl, 
desbenzoyl, and desmethyldesbenzoyl metabolites, all in the unconjugated form. 
About 60 percent of an oral dosage is recovered in urine as drug and metabolites 
(26 percent as indomethacin and its glucuronide), and 33 percent is recovered in 
feces (1.5 percent as indomethacin).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>About 99% of indomethacin is bound to protein in plasma over the expected 
range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Indomethacin has been found to cross 
the blood-brain barrier and the placenta.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-7">WARNINGS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#section-7.2">Gastrointestinal Effects</linkHtml>
                     </content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-6">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs, including indomethacin, can lead to onset of new 
hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may 
contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or 
loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. 
NSAIDs, including indomethacin, should be used with caution in patients with 
hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the 
initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<paragraph>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients 
taking NSAIDs. Indomethacin should be used with caution in patients with fluid 
retention or heart failure.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a study of patients with severe heart failure and hyponatremia, 
indomethacin was associated with significant deterioration of circulatory 
hemodynamics, presumably due to inhibition of prostaglandin dependent 
compensatory mechanisms.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including indomethacin, can cause serious 
gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, 
ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large 
intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any 
time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 
one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID 
therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused 
by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in 
about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer 
duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at 
some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not 
without risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Rarely, in patients taking indomethacin, intestinal ulceration has been 
associated with stenosis and obstruction. Gastrointestinal bleeding without 
obvious ulcer formation and perforation of pre-existing sigmoid lesions 
(diverticulum, carcinoma, etc.) have occurred. Increased abdominal pain in 
ulcerative colitis patients or the development of ulcerative colitis and 
regional ileitis have been reported to occur rarely.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with prior history 
of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. 
Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with 
NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer 
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general 
health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate over renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, patients with volume 
depletion, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed 
by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been 
reported with use of indomethacin, even in some patients without renal 
impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been 
attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#section-8.7">Drug 
Interactions</linkHtml>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies 
regarding the use of indomethacin in patients with advanced renal disease. 
Therefore, treatment with indomethacin is not recommended in these patients with 
advanced renal disease. If indomethacin therapy must be initiated, close 
monitoring of the patient’s renal function is advisable.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions may 
occur in patients without known prior exposure to indomethacin. Indomethacin 
should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex 
typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without 
nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking 
aspirin or other NSAIDs (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-6">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>

Asthma</linkHtml>
                     </content>). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including indomethacin, can cause serious skin adverse 
events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur 
without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the 
first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, indomethacin should be 
avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Ocular Effects<paragraph>Corneal deposits and retinal disturbances, including those of the 
macula, have been observed in some patients who had received prolonged therapy 
with indomethacin. The prescribing physician should be alert to the possible 
association between the changes noted and indomethacin. It is advisable to 
discontinue therapy if such changes are observed. Blurred vision may be a 
significant symptom and warrants a thorough ophthalmological examination. Since 
these changes may be asymptomatic, ophthalmologic examination at periodic 
intervals is desirable in patients where therapy is prolonged.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Central Nervous System Effects<paragraph>Indomethacin may aggravate depression or other psychiatric 
disturbances, epilepsy, and parkinsonism, and should be used with considerable 
caution in patients with these conditions. If severe CNS adverse reactions 
develop, indomethacin should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin may cause drowsiness; therefore, patients should be cautioned 
about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination, 
such as driving a car. Indomethacin may also cause headache. Headache which 
persists despite dosage reduction requires cessation of therapy with 
indomethacin.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Indomethacin cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids 
or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of 
corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is 
made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of indomethacin in reducing fever and 
inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting 
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including indomethacin. These laboratory 
abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with 
continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or 
more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of 
patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe 
hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver 
necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been 
reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with 
indomethacin. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease 
develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), 
indomethacin should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
indomethacin. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, 
or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term 
treatment with NSAIDs, including indomethacin, should have their hemoglobin or 
hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
indomethacin who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, 
such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants,

of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has 
been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, indomethacin should not be 
administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be 
used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>ACE-Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists<paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive 
effect of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. Indomethacin can reduce 
the antihypertensive effects of captopril and losartan. These interactions 
should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with 
ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists. In some patients with compromised 
renal function, the co-administration of an NSAID and an ACE-inhibitor or an 
angiotensin II antagonist may result in further deterioration of renal function, 
including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Aspirin<paragraph>When indomethacin is administered with aspirin, its protein 
binding is reduced, although the clearance of free indomethacin is not altered. 
The clinical significance of this interaction is not known.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The use of indomethacin in conjunction with aspirin or other salicylates is 
not recommended. Controlled clinical studies have shown that the combined use of 
indomethacin and aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than 
the use of indomethacin alone. In a clinical study of the combined use of 
indomethacin and aspirin, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was 
significantly increased with combined therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent 
administration of 3.6 g of aspirin per day decreases indomethacin blood levels 
approximately 20%.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents<paragraph>Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor 
blocking agents by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including indomethacin 
has been reported. Therefore, when using these blocking agents to treat 
hypertension, patients should be observed carefully in order to confirm that the 
desired therapeutic effect has been obtained.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cyclosporine<paragraph>Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in 
cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal 
prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking 
cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diflunisal<paragraph>In normal volunteers receiving indomethacin, the administration 
of diflunisal decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the 
plasma levels of indomethacin. In some patients, combined use of indomethacin 
and diflunisal has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
Therefore, diflunisal and indomethacin should not be used concomitantly.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Digoxin<paragraph>Indomethacin given concomitantly with digoxin has been reported 
to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. 
Therefore, when indomethacin and digoxin are used concomitantly, serum digoxin 
levels should be closely monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diuretics<paragraph>In some patients, the administration of indomethacin can reduce 
the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, 
potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. This response has been attributed to 
inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin reduces basal plasma renin activity (PRA), as well as those 
elevations of PRA induced by furosemide administration, or salt or volume 
depletion. These facts should be considered when evaluating plasma renin 
activity in hypertensive patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It has been reported that the addition of triamterene to a maintenance 
schedule of indomethacin resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of 
four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered 
together.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics each may be associated with 
increased serum potassium levels. The potential effects of indomethacin and 
potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium kinetics and renal function should be 
considered when these agents are administered concurrently.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Most of the above effects concerning diuretics have been attributed, at least 
in part, to mechanisms involving inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by 
indomethacin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed 
closely for signs of renal failure (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-7">WARNINGS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#section-7.3">Renal 
Effects</linkHtml>
                     </content>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Lithium<paragraph>Indomethacin capsules 50 mg t.i.d. produced a clinically relevant 
elevation of plasma lithium and reduction in renal lithium clearance in 
psychiatric patients and normal subjects with steady state plasma lithium 
concentrations. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin 
synthesis. As a consequence, when NSAIDs and lithium are given concomitantly, 
the patient should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity. (Read 
circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.) In 
addition, the frequency of monitoring serum lithium concentration should be 
increased at the outset of such combination drug treatment.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Methotrexate<paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance 
the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>NSAIDs<paragraph>The concomitant use of indomethacin with other NSAIDs is not 
recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with 
little or no increase in efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Oral Anticoagulants<paragraph>Clinical studies have shown that indomethacin does not influence 
the hypoprothrombinemia produced by anticoagulants. However, when any additional 
drug, including indomethacin, is added to the treatment of patients on 
anticoagulant therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the 
prothrombin time. In post-marketing experience, bleeding has been reported in 
patients on concomitant treatment with anticoagulants and indomethacin. Caution 
should be exercised when indomethacin and anticoagulants are administered 
concomitantly. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are 
synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI 
bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Probenecid<paragraph>When indomethacin is given to patients receiving probenecid, the 
plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased. Therefore, a lower 
total daily dosage of indomethacin may produce a satisfactory therapeutic 
effect. When increases in the dose of indomethacin are made, they should be made 
carefully and in small increments.</paragraph>

0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/kg/day. Except for retarded fetal ossification at 4 
mg/kg/day considered secondary to the decreased average fetal weights, no 
increase in fetal malformations was observed as compared with control groups. 
Other studies in mice reported in the literature using higher doses (5 to 15 
mg/kg/day) have described maternal toxicity and death, increased fetal 
resorptions, and fetal malformations. Comparable studies in rodents using high 
doses of aspirin have shown similar maternal and fetal effects. However, animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The known effects of indomethacin and other drugs of this class on the human 
fetus during the third trimester of pregnancy include: constriction of the 
ductus arteriosus prenatally, tricuspid incompetence, and pulmonary 
hypertension; non-closure of the ductus arteriosus postnatally which may be 
resistant to medical management; myocardial degenerative changes, platelet 
dysfunction with resultant bleeding, intracranial bleeding, renal dysfunction or 
failure, renal injury/dysgenesis which may result in prolonged or permanent 
renal failure, oligohydramnios, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and 
increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In rats and mice, 4.0 mg/kg/day given during the last three days of gestation 
caused a decrease in maternal weight gain and some maternal and fetal deaths. An 
increased incidence of neuronal necrosis in the diencephalon in the live-born 
fetuses was observed. At 2.0 mg/kg/day, no increase in neuronal necrosis was 
observed as compared to the control groups. Administration of 0.5 or 4.0 
mg/kg/day during the first three days of life did not cause an increase in 
neuronal necrosis at either dose level.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Indomethacin should not be prescribed for pediatric patients 14 years of age 
and younger unless toxicity or lack of efficacy associated with other drugs 
warrants the risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In experience with more than 900 pediatric patients reported in the 
literature or to the manufacturer who were treated with indomethacin capsules, 
side effects in pediatric patients were comparable to those reported in adults.

of liver function is recommended. There have been cases of hepatotoxicity 
reported in pediatric patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, including 
fatalities. If indomethacin treatment is instituted, a suggested starting dose 
is 1-2 mg/kg/day given in divided doses. Maximum daily dosage should not exceed 
3 mg/kg/day or 150-200 mg/day, whichever is less. Limited data are available to 
support the use of a maximum daily dosage of 4 mg/kg/day or 150-200 mg/day,

                  <paragraph>In a gastroscopic study in 45 healthy subjects, the number of 
gastric mucosal abnormalities was significantly higher in the group receiving 
indomethacin capsules or placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a double-blind comparative clinical study involving 175 patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, however, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse 
effects with indomethacin capsules was comparable.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The adverse reactions for indomethacin capsules listed in the following table 
have been arranged into two groups: (1) incidence greater than 1%; and (2) 
incidence less than 1%. The incidence for group (1) was obtained from 33 
double-blind controlled clinical trials reported in the literature (1,092 
patients). The incidence for group (2) was based on reports in clinical trials, 
in the literature, and on voluntary reports since marketing. The probability of 
a causal relationship exists between indomethacin and these adverse reactions, 
some of which have been reported only rarely.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The following symptoms may be observed following overdosage: 
nausea, vomiting, intense headache, dizziness, mental confusion, disorientation, 
or lethargy. There have been reports of paresthesias, numbness, and 
convulsions.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The stomach should be emptied as 
quickly as possible if the ingestion is recent. If vomiting has not occurred 
spontaneously, the patient should be induced to vomit with syrup of ipecac. If 
the patient is unable to vomit, gastric lavage should be performed. Once the 
stomach has been emptied, 25 or 50 g of activated charcoal may be given. 
Depending on the condition of the patient, close medical observation and nursing 
care may be required. The patient should be followed for several days because 
gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhage have been reported as adverse 
reactions of indomethacin. Use of antacids may be helpful.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of indomethacin in mice and rats (based 
on 14 day mortality response) was 50 and 12 mg/kg, respectively.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with indomethacin, the dose

                     <item>Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic 
disease; moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis; and moderate to severe 
osteoarthritis.<br/>Suggested Dosage:<br/>Indomethacin capsules 25 mg b.i.d. or 
t.i.d. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 25 or by 50 mg, 
if required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory 
response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150-200 mg is reached. DOSES 
ABOVE THIS AMOUNT GENERALLY DO NOT INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG.<br/>In 
patients who have persistent night pain and/or morning stiffness, the giving of 
a large portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at bedtime 
may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 
mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be necessary to 
increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily.<br/>If minor 
adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to 
a tolerated dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY.<br/>If severe adverse reactions 
occur, STOP THE DRUG. After the acute phase of the disease is under control, an 
attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made repeatedly until the patient is 
receiving the smallest effective dose or the drug is discontinued.<br/>Careful 
instructions to, and observations of, the individual patient are essential to 
the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse 
reactions.<br/>As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse 
reactions, indomethacin should be used with greater care in the elderly (see

                     <item>Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis).<br/>Initial 
Dose:<br/>75-150 mg daily in 3 or 4 divided doses.<br/>The drug should be 
discontinued after the signs and symptoms of inflammation have been controlled 
for several days. The usual course of therapy is 7-14 days.</item>
                     <item>Acute gouty arthritis.<br/>Suggested Dosage:<br/>Indomethacin capsules 50 mg 
t.i.d. until pain is tolerable. The dose should then be rapidly reduced to 
complete cessation of the drug. Definite relief of pain has been reported within 
2 to 4 hours. Tenderness and heat usually subside in 24 to 36 hours, and 
swelling gradually disappears in 3 to 5 days.</item>
