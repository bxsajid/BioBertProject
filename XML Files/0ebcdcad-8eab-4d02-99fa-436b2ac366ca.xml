                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacodynamics<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) that exhibits analgesic activity in animal models. The mechanism of 
action of ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but 
may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. The biological activity 
of ketorolac tromethamine is associated with the S-form. Ketorolac tromethamine 
possesses no sedative or anxiolytic properties.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The peak analgesic effect of ketorolac tromethamine occurs within 2 to 3 
hours and is not statistically significantly different over the recommended 
dosage range of ketorolac tromethamine. The greatest difference between large 
and small doses of ketorolac tromethamine is in the duration of analgesia.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacokinetics<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and 
[+]R-enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having analgesic activity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Comparison of IV, IM and Oral Pharmacokinetics<paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of ketorolac tromethamine, following IV, IM 
and oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine tablets, are compared in <linkHtml href="#id_f8fb9559-f38d-4819-8476-1f7b0d1566ef">Table 1</linkHtml>. In adults, the 
extent of bioavailability following administration of the oral and IM forms of 
ketorolac tromethamine was equal to that following an IV bolus.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Linear Kinetics<paragraph>In adults, following administration of single oral, IM or IV 
doses of ketorolac tromethamine in the recommended dosage ranges, the clearance 
of the racemate does not change. This implies that the pharmacokinetics of 
ketorolac tromethamine in adults, following single or multiple IM, IV or 
recommended oral doses of ketorolac tromethamine, are linear. At the higher 
recommended doses, there is a proportional increase in the concentrations of 
free and bound racemate.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Absorption<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine is 100% absorbed after oral administration 
(see <linkHtml href="#id_f8fb9559-f38d-4819-8476-1f7b0d1566ef">Table 1</linkHtml>). Oral 
administration of ketorolac tromethamine after a high-fat meal resulted in 
decreased peak and delayed time-to-peak concentrations of ketorolac tromethamine 
by about one hour. Antacids did not affect the extent of absorption.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Distribution<paragraph>The mean apparent volume (V<sub>β</sub>) of ketorolac 
tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This 
parameter was determined from single-dose data. The ketorolac tromethamine 
racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99%). Nevertheless, plasma 
concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the 
albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be 
constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will 
result in increased free drug concentrations.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine is excreted in human milk (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_ec74e762-2aff-4036-9144-c3343b158d16">PRECAUTIONS: Nursing 
Mothers</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Metabolism<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The 
metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The 
products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the 
urine.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Excretion<paragraph>The principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its 
metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, 
approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged ketorolac. Approximately 
6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg ketorolac 
tromethamine (n = 9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately 
2 times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of 
the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma 
concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no 
inversion of the R- to S- form in humans. The clearance of the racemate in 
normal subjects, elderly individuals and in hepatically and renally impaired 
patients is outlined in <linkHtml href="#id_b4134aab-f423-40d9-ac0f-d1f170a686fc">Table 
2</linkHtml> (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_96c2b21d-d6e0-4ece-a638-dd55f9810baa">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY: Kinetics in Special Populations</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 
2.5 hours (SD ± 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD ± 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In 
other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within 
the range of 5 to 6 hours.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Accumulation<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine administered as an IV bolus every 6 hours 
for 5 days to healthy subjects (n = 13), showed no significant difference in 
C<sub>max</sub> on Day 1 and Day 5. Trough levels averaged 0.29 
mcg/mL (SD ± 0.13) on Day 1 and 0.55 mcg/mL (SD ± 0.23) on Day 6. Steady-state 
was approached after the fourth dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Accumulation of ketorolac tromethamine has not been studied in special 
populations (geriatric, pediatric, renal failure or hepatic disease 
patients).</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Patients<paragraph>Based on single-dose data only, the half-life of the ketorolac 
tromethamine racemate increased from 5 to 7 hours in the elderly (65 to 78 
years) compared with young healthy volunteers (24 to 35 years) (see <linkHtml href="#id_b4134aab-f423-40d9-ac0f-d1f170a686fc">Table 2</linkHtml>). There was little 
difference in the C<sub>max</sub> for the two groups (elderly, 2.52 
mcg/mL ± 0.77; young, 2.99 mcg/mL ± 1.03) (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_3d7bdd4b-6b4f-4dad-8a2d-45721484a0d8">PRECAUTIONS:

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pediatric Patients<paragraph>Limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics 
of dosing of ketorolac tromethamine in the pediatric population. Following a 
single intravenous bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 children 4 to 8 years old, the 
half-life was 5.8 ± 1.6 hours, the average clearance was 0.042 ± 0.01 L/hr/kg, 
the volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V<sub>β</sub>) 
was 0.34 ± 0.12 L/kg and the volume of distribution at steady state (V<sub>ss</sub>) was 0.26 ± 0.08 L/kg. The volume of distribution and 
clearance of ketorolac in pediatric patients was higher than those observed in 
adult subjects (see <linkHtml href="#id_f8fb9559-f38d-4819-8476-1f7b0d1566ef">Table 
1</linkHtml>). There are no pharmacokinetic data available for administration of 
ketorolac tromethamine by the IM route in pediatric patients.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Insufficiency<paragraph>Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of ketorolac 
tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours and is 
dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between 
creatinine clearance and total ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly 
and populations with renal impairment (r = 0.5).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with renal disease, the AUC<sub>∞</sub> of each 
enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The 
volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for 
the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of ketorolac 
tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The AUC<sub>∞</sub>-ratio of the ketorolac tromethamine 
enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there 
was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy 
subjects (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_9093d679-4e5e-4c4b-8655-aef4958ade1d">WARNINGS: Renal

                  <paragraph>The most serious risks associated with ketorolac tromethamine are:</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, 
Bleeding and Perforation<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with 
previously documented peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding. Ketorolac tromethamine 
can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, 
ulceration and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, 
which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or 
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with ketorolac tromethamine.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on 
NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as 
dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy. The 
incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with 
increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with, ketorolac tromethamine. Do 
not use ketorolac tromethamine for more than 5 days. However, even short-term 
therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other 
factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs 
include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer 
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age and poor general 
health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the 
lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. 
</content>Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI 
ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional 
evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should 
include discontinuation of ketorolac tromethamine until a serious GI adverse 
event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not 
involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory 
bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as their condition may be 
exacerbated.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hemorrhage<paragraph>Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and 
NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation as well, use of ketorolac tromethamine in 
patients who have coagulation disorders should be undertaken very cautiously, 
and those patients should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses 
of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased 
risk of bleeding complications if given ketorolac tromethamine concurrently; 
therefore, physicians should administer such concomitant therapy only extremely 
cautiously. The concurrent use of ketorolac tromethamine and therapy that 
affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low-dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units 
q12h), warfarin and dextrans have not been studied extensively, but may also be 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are 
available, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and 
use such concomitant therapy in these patients only extremely cautiously. 
Patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis should be monitored 
closely.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In post-marketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of 
wound bleeding have been reported in association with the perioperative use of 
IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, perioperative use of 
ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken 
with caution when hemostasis is critical (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_precautions_id_860b7c9a-c82a-4ed9-b18a-ccd305f2f132">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may 
cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in 
renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at 
greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart 
failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the 
elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the 
kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in 
diminished clearance of the drug (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_clinical_pharmacology_id_f462b521-748f-474c-a05c-93686e088d85">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>). Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution 
in patients with impaired renal function (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_dosage_admin_id_b32a4d0a-1f56-4057-bd33-b0c1094c8ad0">DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>) and such patients should be followed closely. With the use 
of ketorolac tromethamine, there have been reports of acute renal failure, 
interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Impaired Renal Function<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine <content styleCode="bold">is </content>contraindicated 
in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal 
impairment (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1547759c-315e-4823-8688-855a3003203d">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>). 
Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired 
renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor 
of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency 
are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the 
risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to 
these patients.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients without a known previous exposure or hypersensitivity to ketorolac 
tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the 
aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who 
experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, 
potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1547759c-315e-4823-8688-855a3003203d">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml> 
and <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_7aa24c77-e274-46b5-ae24-0a57c9fe3e02">PRECAUTIONS: 
Preexisting Asthma</linkHtml>). Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a 
fatal outcome. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid 
reaction occurs.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_87c55365-7dfc-495e-b041-a8fe965e053d">Gastrointestinal 
Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation</linkHtml>). Two large, 
controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain 
in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence 
of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1547759c-315e-4823-8688-855a3003203d">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, can lead to onset of 
new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may 
contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or 
loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. 
NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, should be used with caution in 
patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely

adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events 
may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and 
symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be 
discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions or any other 
sign of hypersensitivity.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine cannot be expected to substitute for 
corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation 
of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is 
made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of ketorolac tromethamine in reducing 
inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting 
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effect<paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients 
with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline 
elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking 
NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may 
progress, may remain unchanged or may be transient with continuing therapy. 
Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit 
of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials 
with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including 
jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some 
of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketorolac 
tromethamine. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease 
develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), 
ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematologic Effect<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
ketorolac tromethamine. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI 
blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on 
long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ketorolac tromethamine, should have 
their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of 
anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong 
bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet 
function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients 
receiving ketorolac tromethamine who may be adversely affected by alterations in 
platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients 
receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ketorolac tromethamine 
should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and 
should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>

compared to a mean of 6 minutes (3.4 to 7.5 min) for heparin alone and 5.1 
minutes (3.5 to 8.5 min) for placebo. Although these results do not indicate a 
significant interaction between ketorolac tromethamine and warfarin or heparin, 
the administration of ketorolac tromethamine to patients taking anticoagulants 
should be done extremely cautiously and patients should be closely monitored 
(see <linkHtml href="#i4i_warnings_id_1b02597b-565e-4de4-9021-b437e912d15d">WARNINGS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_e2911d59-11a2-42cd-b151-a6982975ee2f">PRECAUTIONS:

protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ketorolac 
tromethamine is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is 
not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diuretics<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have 
shown that ketorolac tromethamine can reduce the natriuretic effect of 
furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to 
inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with 
NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see 
<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_9093d679-4e5e-4c4b-8655-aef4958ade1d">WARNINGS: Renal

decreased clearance and volume of distribution of ketorolac and significant 
increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately 3-fold 
from 5.4 to 17.8 mcg/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately 2-fold 
from 6.6 to 15.1 hours. Therefore, concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Lithium<paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These 
effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by 
the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects 
should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nonteratogenic Effects<paragraph>Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use 
during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Oral doses of 
ketorolac tromethamine at 1.5 mg/kg (0.14 times the human AUC), administered 
after gestation day 17, caused dystocia and higher pup mortality in rats.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There are no adequate and well controlled studies of ketorolac tromethamine

adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus 
increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_1547759c-315e-4823-8688-855a3003203d">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Effects on Fertility<paragraph>The use of ketorolac tromethamine, as with any drug known to 
inhibit cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin synthesis, may impair fertility and is not 
recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulty 
conceiving or are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of 
ketorolac tromethamine should be considered.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>After a single administration of 10 mg of oral ketorolac 
tromethamine to humans, the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL 
and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.037. After one day of dosing 
(q.i.d.), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL and the maximum 
milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Because of the possible adverse effects of 
prostaglandin-inhibiting drugs on neonates, use in nursing mothers is 
contraindicated.</paragraph>

pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of ketorolac tromethamine 
tablets in pediatric patients below the age of 17 have not been 
established.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Adverse reaction rates increase with higher doses of ketorolac 
tromethamine. Practitioners should be alert for the severe complications of 
treatment with ketorolac tromethamine, such as G.I. ulceration, bleeding and 
perforation, postoperative bleeding, acute renal failure, anaphylactic and 
anaphylactoid reactions and liver failure (see Boxed WARNING, <linkHtml href="#section-"> WARNINGS</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>, 
and <linkHtml href="#section-"> DOSAGE 
AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>). These NSAID-related complications can be serious in 
certain patients for whom ketorolac tromethamine is indicated, especially when 
the drug is used inappropriately.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients taking ketorolac tromethamine or other NSAIDs in clinical trials, 
the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of 
patients are:</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Symptoms and Signs<paragraph>Symptoms following acute NSAIDs overdoses are usually limited to 
lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain, which are generally 
reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. 
Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, 
but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic 
ingestion of NSAIDs and may occur following an overdose.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Treatment<paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care 
following a NSAIDs overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or 
activated charcoal (60 g to 100 g in adults, 1 g/kg to 2 g/kg in children) 
and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of 
ingestion with symptoms or following a large oral overdose (5 to 10 times the 
usual dose). Forced diuresis, alkalization of urine, hemodialysis or 
hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Single overdoses of ketorolac tromethamine have been variously associated 
with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation, peptic ulcers and/or 
erosive gastritis and renal dysfunction which have resolved after 
discontinuation of dosing.</paragraph>
