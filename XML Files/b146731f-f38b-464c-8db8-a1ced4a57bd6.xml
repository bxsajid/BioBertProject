                  <paragraph>CLINICAL TRIALS OF SEVERAL COX-2 SELECTIVE AND NON-SELECTIVE NSAIDS OF UP TO THREE YEARS DURATION HAVE SHOWN AN INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR (CV) THROMBOTIC EVENTS, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, AND STROKE, WHICH CAN BE FATAL. BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA, IT IS UNCLEAR THAT THE RISK FOR CV THROMBOTIC EVENTS IS SIMILAR FOR ALL NSAIDS. THE RELATIVE INCREASE IN SERIOUS CV THROMBOTIC EVENTS OVER BASELINE CONFERRED BY NSAID USE APPEARS TO BE SIMILAR IN THOSE WITH AND WITHOUT KNOWN CV DISEASE OR RISK FACTORS FOR CV DISEASE. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WITH KNOWN CV DISEASE OR RISK FACTORS HAD A HIGHER ABSOLUTE INCIDENCE OF EXCESS SERIOUS CV THROMBOTIC EVENTS, DUE TO THEIR INCREASED BASELINE RATE. SOMEOBSERVATIONAL STUDIES FOUND THAT THIS INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS CV THROMBOTIC EVENTS BEGAN AS EARLY AS THE FIRST WEEKS OF TREATMENT. THE INCREASE IN CV THROMBOTIC RISK HAS BEEN OBSERVED MOST CONSISTENTLY AT HIGHER DOSES.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL RISK FOR AN ADVERSE CV EVENT IN NSAID-TREATED PATIENTS, USE THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE FOR THE SHORTEST DURATION POSSIBLE. PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS SHOULD REMAIN ALERT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH EVENTS, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TREATMENT COURSE, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF PREVIOUS CV SYMPTOMS. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS CV EVENTS AND THE STEPS TO TAKE IF THEY OCCUR.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>THERE IS NO CONSISTENT EVIDENCE THAT CONCURRENT USE OF ASPIRIN MITIGATES THE INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS CV THROMBOTIC EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH NSAID USE. THE CONCURRENT USE OF ASPIRIN AND AN NSAID, SUCH AS NAPROXEN, INCREASES THE RISK OF SERIOUS GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) EVENTS (SEE WARNINGS; GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING, ULCERATION, AND PERFORATION).</paragraph>

IN THIS SAME COHORT, THE INCIDENCE OF DEATH IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-MI WAS 20 PER 100 PERSON YEARS IN NSAID-TREATED PATIENTS COMPARED TO 12 PER 100 PERSON YEARS IN NON-NSAID EXPOSED PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH THE ABSOLUTE RATE OF DEATH DECLINED SOMEWHAT</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>AFTER THE FIRST YEAR POST-MI, THE INCREASED RELATIVE RISK OF DEATH IN NSAID USERS PERSISTED OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP.</paragraph>

THESE SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT WARNING SYMPTOMS, IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH NSAIDS. ONLY ONE IN FIVE PATIENTS WHO DEVELOP A SERIOUS UPPER GI ADVERSE EVENT ON NSAID THERAPY IS SYMPTOMATIC.

ONSET OF PAIN RELIEF CAN BEGIN WITHIN 1 HOUR IN PATIENTS TAKING NAPROXEN.
