                  <paragraph>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events,including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. 
  <br/>
Diclofenac sodium topical gel is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].</paragraph>

               <title>Warnings and Precautions</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Post-MI Patients </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium topical gel is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. 
  <br/>
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. 
  <br/>
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. 
  <br/>
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. 
  <br/>
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium topical gel until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. 
  <br/>
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.3 Hepatotoxicity</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In clinical trials, of oral diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of 3,700 patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium topical gel should be discontinued immediately. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium topical gel immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium topical gel with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti-epileptics).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.4 Hypertension </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.5 Heart Failure and Edem</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium topical gel is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal Toxicity</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium topical gel may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium topical gel. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium topical gel [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium topical gel is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Hyperkalemia 
  <br/>
Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.7 Anaphylactoid Reactions </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [seeCONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium topical gel is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. When diclofenac sodium topical gel is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.9 Serious Skin Reactions </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. diclofenac sodium topical gel is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.11 Hematologic Toxicity</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium topical gel in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.13 Laboratory Monitoring </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.14 Sun Exposure </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight on treated areas because studies in animals indicated topical diclofenac treatment resulted in an earlier onset of ultraviolet light induced skin tumors. The potential effects of diclofenac sodium topical gel on skin response to ultraviolet damage in humans are not known.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.15 Eye Exposure </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Contact of diclofenac sodium topical gel with eyes and mucosa, although not studied, should be avoided. Patients should be advised that if eye contact occurs, they should immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5.16 Oral Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant use of oral and topical NSAIDs may result in a higher rate of hemorrhage, more frequent abnormal creatinine, urea and hemoglobin. Do not use combination therapy with diclofenac sodium topical gel and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During clinical development, 913 patients were exposed to diclofenac sodium topical gel in randomized, double-blind, multicenter, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group studies in osteoarthritis of the superficial joints of the extremities. Of these, 513 patients received diclofenac sodium topical gel for osteoarthritis of the knee and 400 were treated for osteoarthritis of the hand. Additionally, 583 patients were exposed to diclofenac sodium topical gel in an uncontrolled, open-label, long-term safety trial in osteoarthritis of the knee. Of these, 355 patients were treated for osteoarthritis of 1 knee and 228 were treated for osteoarthritis of both knees. Duration of exposure ranged from 8 to 12 weeks for the placebo-controlled studies, and up to 12 months for the open-label safety trial. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Adverse reactions observed in at least 1% of patients treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Non-serious adverse reactions that were reported during the short-term placebo-controlled studies comparing diclofenac sodium topical gel and placebo (vehicle gel) over study periods of 8 to 12 weeks (16 g per day), were application site reactions. These were the only adverse reactions that occurred in &gt; 1% of treated patients with a greater frequency in the diclofenac sodium topical gel group (7%) than the placebo group (2%). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Table 1 lists the types of application site reactions reported. Application site dermatitis was the most frequent type of application site reaction and was reported by 4% of patients treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel, compared to 1% of placebo patients. </paragraph>

               <title>Drug Interactions</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. 
  <br/>
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Aspirin </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium topical gel is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol)
  <br/>
In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.
  <br/>
During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
  <br/>
When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diuretics </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Digoxin </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Lithium </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methotrexate </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Cyclosporine </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs and Salicylates </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pemetrexed </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Impact: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intervention: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and Gl toxicity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration. </paragraph>

               <title>Use in Specific Populations</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>8.1 Pregnancy</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting 30 weeks gestation </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Risk Summary </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium topical gel in pregnant women. Human and animal studies indicate that diclofenac crosses the placenta. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, or rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 5, 5, and 10 times, respectively, the maximum recommended topical dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses [see Data]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clinical Considerations 
  <br/>
Labor or Delivery
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium topical gel during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Data 
  <br/>
Animal data
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac sodium topical gel based on bioavailability and body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 and 10 times the MRHD based on bioavailability and BSA comparison). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a study in which pregnant rats were orally administered 2 or 4 mg/kg diclofenac (approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD based on bioavailability and BSA comparison) from Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21, significant maternal toxicity (peritonitis, mortality) was noted. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.2 Lactation</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Risk Summary 
  <br/>
Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for CATAFLAM and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the CATAFLAM or from the underlying maternal condition. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Data 
  <br/>
One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt, 150 mg/day, had a milk diclofenac level of 100 mcg/L, equivalent to an infant dose of about 0.03 mg/kg/day. Diclofenac was not detectable in breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac (after either 100 mg/day orally for 7 days or a single 50 mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period).
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Infertility 
  <br/>
Females 
  <br/>
Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

                  <paragraph>8.4 Pediatric Use</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>8.5 Geriatric Use</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Of the total number of subjects treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel in clinical studies, 498 were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity to the effect of NSAIDs in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac, as with any NSAID, is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to diclofenac sodium topical gel may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken when using diclofenac sodium topical gel in the elderly, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. </paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>There has been no experience of overdose with diclofenac sodium topical gel. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding. For additional information about overdose treatment, call a Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>12.1 Mechanism of Action</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium topical gel, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>​12.3 Pharmacokinetics</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel were assessed in healthy volunteers following repeated applications during 7 days of diclofenac sodium topical gel to 1 knee (4 x 4 g per day) or to 2 knees and 2 hands (4 x 12 g per day) versus the recommended oral dose of diclofenac sodium for the treatment of osteoarthritis (3 x 50 mg per day). A summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Table 2. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Systemic exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) and maximum plasma concentrations of diclofenac are significantly lower with diclofenac sodium topical gel than with comparable oral treatment of diclofenac sodium. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Systemic exposure with recommended use of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day applied to 1 knee) is on average 17 times lower than with oral treatment. (Basis: treatment with diclofenac sodium topical gel of 1 knee, 4 times a day versus 50 mg, 3 times a day of oral diclofenac tablets.) The amount of diclofenac sodium that is systemically absorbed from diclofenac sodium topical gel is on average 6% of the systemic exposure from an oral form of diclofenac sodium. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The average peak plasma concentration with recommended use of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day applied to 1 knee) is 158 times lower than with the oral treatment. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel has been tested under conditions of moderate heat (application of a heat patch for 15 minutes prior to gel application) and of moderate exercise (first gel application followed by a 20-minute treadmill exercise). No clinically relevant differences of systemic absorption and of tolerability were found between applications of diclofenac sodium topical gel (4 x 4 g per day on 1 knee) with and under the conditions tested. However, the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium topical gel were not tested under the condition of heat application following gel application. Therefore, concurrent use of diclofenac sodium topical gel and heat is not recommended. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Drug Interaction Studies </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7)].</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Carcinogenesis
  <br/>
Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats administered diclofenac sodium as a dietary constituent for 2 years at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human topical dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel based on bioavailability and body surface area (BSA) comparison) resulted in no significant increases in tumor. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a dermal carcinogenicity study conducted in albino mice, daily topical applications of a diclofenac sodium gel product for two years at concentrations up to 0.035% diclofenac sodium (a 29-fold lower diclofenac sodium concentration than present in diclofenac sodium topical gel) did not increase neoplasm incidence. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a photococarcinogenicity study conducted in hairless mice, topical application of a diclofenac sodium gel product at doses up to 0.035% diclofenac sodium (a 29-fold lower diclofenac sodium concentration than present in diclofenac sodium topical gel) resulted in an earlier median time of onset of tumors incidence. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Mutagenesis 
  <br/>
Diclofenac was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity tests that included the bacterial reverse mutation assay, in vitro mouse lymphoma point mutation assay, chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamster ovarian cells in vitro, and in vivo rat chromosomal aberration assay of bone marrow cells. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Impairment of Fertility 
  <br/>
Diclofenac did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times than the maximum human topical dose of diclofenac sodium topical gel based on bioavailability and BSA comparison).

Diclofenac sodium topical gel was administered at a dose of 4 g, 4 times daily, on 1 knee (16 g per day). Pain as assessed by the patients at Week 12 using the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) Pain Subindex was lower in the diclofenac sodium topical gel group than the placebo group. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 2 evaluated the efficacy of diclofenac sodium topical gel for the treatment of osteoarthritis in subjects with osteoarthritis of the hand in an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Diclofenac sodium topical gel was administered at a dose of 2 g per hand, 4 times daily, on both hands (16 g per day). Pain in the target hand as assessed by the patients at Weeks 4 and 6 on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100 was lower in the diclofenac sodium topical gel group than the placebo group. </paragraph>

  <br/>
with longer use of NSAIDs 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Do not take NSAIDs right before or after a heart surgery called a “coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).” </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Important: Use the dosing card that is inside the diclofenac sodium topical gelcarton to correctly measure each dose. The dosing card is re-usable. Do not throw the dosing card away. Before you use diclofenac sodium topical gelfor the first time, your healthcare provider or pharmacist should show you how to correctly measure your dose using the dosing card. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Read this Instructions for Use before you start using diclofenac sodium topical gel and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Your healthcare provider has prescribed diclofenac sodium topical gel to help relieve arthritis pain in some of your joints. Diclofenac sodium topical gel may be used to treat arthritis pain in the arms (hands, wrists, and elbows) and in the legs (feet, ankles, and knees).  It is not known if diclofenac sodium topical gel is safe and effective if used on your spine, hips, or shoulders. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Use diclofenac sodium topical gel exactly how your healthcare provider prescribes it for you. Do not apply diclofenac sodium topical gel anywhere other than where your healthcare provider tells you to. 
  <br/>
Do not use more than a total of 32 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each day. If you add up the amount of diclofenac sodium topical gel as directed by your healthcare provider, it should not be more than 32 grams in one day. 
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The dose for your hands, wrists, or elbows is 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each time you apply it. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel 4 times a day (a total of 8 grams each day). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Do not apply more than 8 grams each day to any one of your affected hands, wrists, or elbows. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The dose for your feet, ankles, or knees is 4 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel each time you apply it. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Apply diclofenac sodium topical gel 4 times a day (a total of 16 grams each day). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Do not apply more than 16 grams each day to any one of your affected feet, ankles, or knees. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Some examples of diclofenac sodium topical gel application include: </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you use 2 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one hand, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 8 grams. 
  <br/>
If you use 4 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel on one knee, 4 times a day, your total dose for one day is 16 grams. 
  <br/>
Your total dose for one day, treating one hand and one knee, is 8 grams plus 16 grams, which equals 24 grams of diclofenac sodium topical gel.

                  <paragraph>Step 1. Remove the dosing card that is attached inside the diclofenac sodium topical gel carton.
