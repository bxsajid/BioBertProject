                  <paragraph>Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that 
exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal 
models. The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not 
completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase 
inhibition.</paragraph>

                  <content>Absorption</content>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to 
IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass 
metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available. In some fasting volunteers, measurable plasma levels are observed 
within 10 minutes of dosing with diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets. 
Peak plasma levels are achieved approximately 1 hour in fasting normal 
volunteers, with a range of .33 to 2 hours. Food has no significant effect on 
the extent of diclofenac absorption. However, there is usually a delay in the 
onset of absorption and a reduction in peak plasma levels of approximately 30%.</paragraph>

                  <content>Distribution</content>
                  <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac potassium 
is 1.3 L/kg.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>      Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to 
albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range 
(0.15-105 µg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>      Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into 
the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, 
after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than

                  <paragraph>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma 
and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 
4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. In patients with renal 
dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy- and 
5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after 
single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. However, 
diclofenac metabolites undergo further glucuronidation and sulfation followed by 
biliary excretion.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One diclofenac metabolite 4’-hydroxy-diclofenac has very weak pharmacologic 
activity.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent 
urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of 
the metabolites.<sup> </sup>Little or no free unchanged diclofenac 
is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine 
and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus 
metabolites.<sup> </sup>Because renal elimination is not a 
significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment 
in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The 
terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours.</paragraph>

Events</content>
                  <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see GI WARNINGS).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS).</paragraph>

Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation: </content>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets, 
can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, 
bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large 
intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any 
time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 
one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID 
therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused 
by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in 
about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer 
duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at 
some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not 
without risk. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior 
history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs 
have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to 
patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the 
risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of 
oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, 
smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most 
spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients 
and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered. </paragraph>

potassium immediate-release tablets in patients with considerable 
dehydration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis 
and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom 
renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal 
perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, 
secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal 
decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with 
impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking 
diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.      </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses are usually limited to 
lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally 
reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. 
Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, 
but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic 
ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an 
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated 
charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic 
cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with 
symptoms or following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced 
diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be 
useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Patients should be informed of the following 
information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the 
course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID 
Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed. </content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>1. Diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, may 
cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in 
hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without 
warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest 
pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for 
medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should 
be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, CARDIOVASCULAR 
EFFECTS). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>2. Diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, can 
cause GI discomfort and, rarely, more serious GI side effects, such as ulcers 
and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although 
serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, 
patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, 
and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms 
including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should 
be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal 
Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>3. Diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, can 
cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, 
which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin 
reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and 
symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity 
such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative 
signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if 
they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible. 
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>4. Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight 
gain or edema to their physicians. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of 
hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper 
quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If these occur, patients should 
be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>6. Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction 
(e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, 
patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS). 
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>7. In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diclofenac potassium 
immediate-release tablets should be avoided because it may cause premature 
closure of the ductus arteriosus. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
bleeding. In patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac 
potassium immediate-release tablets, the CBC and a chemistry profile (including 
transaminase levels) should be checked periodically. If clinical signs and 
symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations 
occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or 
worsen, diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets should be 
discontinued.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have 
shown that diclofenac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and 
thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of 
renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the 
patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS – 
Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These 
effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by 
the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects 
should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>
