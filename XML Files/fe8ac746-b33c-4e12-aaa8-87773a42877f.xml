               <text>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal drug with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties. Its mode of action, like that of other anti-inflammatory drugs, is not known. However, its therapeutic action is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Concentrations are reached during therapy which have been demonstrated to have an effect <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> as well. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Moreover, prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of inflammation. Since indomethacin is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, appropriate for long-term use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoarthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin affords relief of symptoms; it does not alter the progressive course of the underlying disease.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin suppresses inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis as demonstrated by relief of pain and reduction of fever, swelling and tenderness. Improvement in patients treated with indomethacin for rheumatoid arthritis has been demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, average number of joints involved and morning stiffness; by increased mobility as demonstrated by a decrease in walking time; and by improved functional capability as demonstrated by an increase in grip strength. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin has been reported to diminish basal and CO<sub>2</sub> stimulated cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers following acute oral and intravenous administration. In one study, after one week of treatment with orally administered indomethacin, this effect on basal cerebral blood flow had disappeared. The clinical significance of this effect has not been established.
                  <br/>Indomethacin extended-release capsules (75 mg) are designed to release 25 mg of drug initially and the remaining 50 mg over approximately 12 hours (90% of dose absorbed by 12 hours). Plasma concentrations of indomethacin fluctuate less and are more sustained following administration of indomethacin extended-release capsules than following administration of 25 mg indomethacin capsules given at 4 to 6 hour intervals. In multiple-dose comparisons, the mean daily steady state plasma level of indomethacin attained with daily administration of indomethacin extended-release capsules 75 mg was indistinguishable from that following indomethacin 25 mg capsules given at 0, 6 and 12 hours daily. However, there was a significant difference in indomethacin plasma levels between the two dosage regimens especially after 12 hours.<br/>
                     <br/>Controlled clinical studies of safety and efficacy in patients with osteoarthritis have shown that one capsule of indomethacin extended-release was clinically comparable to one 25 mg indomethacin capsule t.i.d.; and in controlled clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, one capsule of indomethacin extended-release taken in the morning and one in the evening were clinically indistinguishable from one 50 mg capsule of indomethacin t.i.d.<br/>
                     <br/>Indomethacin is eliminated via renal excretion, metabolism and biliary excretion. Indomethacin undergoes appreciable enterohepatic circulation. The mean half-life of indomethacin is estimated to be about 4.5 hours. With a typical therapeutic regimen of  25 or 50 mg t.i.d., the steady state plasma concentrations of indomethacin are an average 1.4 times those following the first dose.<br/>
                     <br/>Indomethacin exists in the plasma as the parent drug and its desmethyl, desbenzoyl and desmethyldesbenzoyl metabolites, all in the unconjugated form. About 60 percent of an oral dosage is recovered in urine as drug and metabolites (26 percent as indomethacin and its glucuronide) and 33 percent is recovered in feces (1.5 percent as indomethacin).<br/>
                     <br/>About 99% of indomethacin is bound to protein in plasma over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Indomethacin has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta.<br/>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of indomethacin extended-release capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use indomethacin extended-release capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <content styleCode="bold">
                           <linkHtml href="#Section_5">WARNINGS</linkHtml>
                        </content>
                     </content>). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin extended-release capsules have been found effective in active stages of the following:
                  <br/>1. Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease. <br/>2. Moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis. <br/>3. Moderate to severe osteoarthritis. <br/>4. Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis). <br/>
                     <br/>Indomethacin extended-release capsules, USP are not recommended for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis.<br/>
                     <br/>Indomethacin may enable the reduction of steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more severe forms of rheumatoid arthritis. In such instances the steroid dosage should be reduced slowly and the patients followed very closely for any possible adverse effects.<br/>
                     <br/>The use of indomethacin in conjunction with aspirin or other salicylates is not recommended. Controlled clinical studies have shown that the combined use of indomethacin and aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of indomethacin alone. Furthermore, in one of these clinical studies, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was significantly increased with combined therapy. (See <content styleCode="bold">

                           <br/>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with a NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.<br/>
                           <br/>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and a NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <content styleCode="bold">

                           <br/>NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.<br/>

                           <text>
                              <paragraph>
                                 <br/>NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.<br/>
                                 <br/>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of <content styleCode="italics">peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status.<br/>
                                 <br/>Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.<br/>
                                 <br/>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate over renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.<br/>

                           <br/>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of indomethacin extended-release capsules in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with indomethacin extended-release capsules is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If indomethacin extended-release capsules therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.<br/>

                           <br/>3. Indomethacin extended-release capsules, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible. <br/>
                           <br/>4. Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians. <br/>
                           <br/>5. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity  (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy. <br/>
                           <br/>6. Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction  (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see <content styleCode="bold">
                              <linkHtml href="#Section_5">WARNINGS</linkHtml>
                           </content>). <br/>7. In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, indomethacin extended-release capsules should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, indomethacin extended-release capsules should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.<br/>

                           <br/>When indomethacin extended-release capsules are administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free indomethacin extended-release capsules is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of indomethacin and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.<br/>

                           <br/>Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that indomethacin extended-release capsules can reduce the natriuretic effect-of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.4">WARNINGS, Renal Effects</linkHtml>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.<br/>

                           <br/>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity.<br/>

                           <br/>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.<br/>

                     <br/>The following symptoms may be observed following overdosage: nausea, vomiting, intense headache, dizziness, mental confusion, disorientation, or lethargy. There have been reports of paresthesias, numbness and convulsions.<br/>
                     <br/>Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The stomach should be emptied as quickly as possible if the ingestion is recent. If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, the patient should be induced to vomit with syrup of ipecac. If the patient is unable to vomit, gastric lavage should be performed. Once the stomach has been emptied, 25 g or 50 g of activated charcoal may be given. Depending on the condition of the patient, close medical observation and nursing care may be required. The patient should be followed for several days because gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhage have been reported as adverse reactions of indomethacin. Use of antacids may be helpful.<br/>
                     <br/>The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of indomethacin in mice and rats (based on 14 day mortality response) was 50 and 12 mg/kg, respectively.<br/>

                     <br/>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of indomethacin extended-release capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use indomethacin extended-release capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#Section_5">WARNINGS</linkHtml>
                     </content>). Indomethacin extended-release capsules 75 mg are available for oral use. Indomethacin extended-release capsules can be administered once a day and can be substituted for indomethacin 25 mg capsules t.i.d. However, there will be significant differences between the two dosage regimens in indomethacin blood levels, especially after 12 hours (see <linkHtml href="#Section_2">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>). In addition, indomethacin extended-release capsules 75 mg b.i.d. can be substituted for indomethacin 50 mg capsules t.i.d. Indomethacin extended-release capsules may be substituted for all the indications of indomethacin capsules except acute gouty arthritis.<br/>
                     <br/>Adverse reactions appear to correlate with the size of the dose of indomethacin in most patients, but not all. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine the smallest effective dosage for the individual patient.<br/>
                     <br/>Always give indomethacin extended-release capsules 75 mg with food, immediately after meals or with antacids to reduce gastric irritation.<br/>

                     <br/>The following recommendations on dosing pertain to immediate-release indomethacin capsules, and provide important information regarding the dosage and administration of indomethacin. The prescriber should be aware of this information when considering and prescribing extended-release indomethacin.<br/>
                     <br/>Indomethacin capsules 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 25 or 50 mg, if required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150 to 200 mg is reached. DOSES ABOVE THIS AMOUNT GENERALLY DO NOT INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG.<br/>
                     <br/>In patients who have persistent night pain and/or morning stiffness, the giving of a large portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at bedtime, either orally or by rectal suppositories, may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be necessary to increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily.<br/>
                     <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">The following information refers to Extended-release Indomethacin Capsules (75 mg): </content>
                     <br/>If indomethacin extended-release capsules are used for initiating indomethacin treatment, one capsule daily should be the usual starting dose in order to observe patient tolerance since 75 mg per day is the maximum recommended starting dose for indomethacin (see above). If indomethacin extended-release capsules are used to increase the daily dose, patients should be observed for possible signs and symptoms of intolerance since the daily increment will exceed the daily increment recommended for other dosage forms. For patients who require 150 mg of indomethacin per day and have demonstrated acceptable tolerance, indomethacin extended-release capsules 75 mg may be prescribed as one capsule twice daily.<br/>
                     <br/>If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY.<br/>
                     <br/>If severe adverse reactions occur, STOP THE DRUG. After the acute phase of the disease is under control, an attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made repeatedly until the patient is receiving the smallest effective dose or the drug is discontinued.<br/>
                     <br/>Careful instructions to and observations of, the individual patient are essential to the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse reactions.<br/>
                     <br/>As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse reactions, indomethacin extended-release capsules should be used with greater care in the aged.<br/>2. Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis). Initial Dose: 75 mg to 150 mg daily. When 150 mg is prescribed, give as one capsule twice daily.<br/>
                     <br/>The drug should be discontinued after the signs and symptoms of inflammation have been controlled for several days. The usual course of therapy is 7 to 14 days.<br/>
