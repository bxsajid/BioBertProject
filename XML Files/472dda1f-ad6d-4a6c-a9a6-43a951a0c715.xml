                  <paragraph ID="ID297">Although the exact mechanism of action through which indomethacin causes closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not known, it is believed to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Indomethacin has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, both <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>. In human newborns with certain congenital heart malformations, PGE 1 dilates the ductus arteriosus. In fetal and newborn lambs, E type prostaglandins have also been shown to maintain the patency of the ductus, and as in human newborns, indomethacin causes its constriction.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies in healthy young animals and in premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus indicated that, after the first dose of intravenous indomethacin, there was a transient reduction in cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral blood flow. Similar decreases in mesenteric blood flow and velocity have been observed. The clinical significance of these effects has not been established.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of indomethacin for injection in 460 small pre-term infants, weighing 1750 g or less, the neonates treated with placebo had a ductus closure rate after 48 hours of 25 to 30 percent, whereas those treated with indomethacin for injection had a 75 to 80 percent closure rate. In one of these studies, a multicenter study, involving 405 pre-term infants, later re opening of the ductus arteriosus occurred in 26 percent of neonates treated with indomethacin for injection, however, 70 percent of these closed subsequently without the need for surgery or additional indomethacin.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The disposition of indomethacin following intravenous administration (0.2 mg/kg) in pre-term neonates with patent ductus arteriosus has not been extensively evaluated. Even though the plasma half-life of indomethacin was variable among premature infants, it was shown to vary inversely with postnatal age and weight. In one study, of 28 neonates who could be evaluated, the plasma half-life in those less than 7 days old averaged 20 hours (range: 3-60 hours, n=18). In neonates older than 7 days, the mean plasma half-life of indomethacin was 12 hours (range: 4-38 hours, n=10). Grouping the neonates by weight, mean plasma half-life in those weighing less than 1000 g was 21 hours (range: 9-60 hours, n=10); in those neonates weighing more than 1000 g, the mean plasma half-life was 15 hours (range: 3-52 hours, n=18).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following intravenous administration in adults, indomethacin is eliminated via renal excretion, metabolism, and biliary excretion. Indomethacin undergoes appreciable enterohepatic circulation. The mean plasma half-life of indomethacin is 4.5 hours. In the absence of enterohepatic circulation, it is 90 minutes. Indomethacin has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In adults, about 99 percent of indomethacin is bound to protein in plasma over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. The percent bound in neonates has not been studied. In controlled trials in premature infants, however, no evidence of bilirubin displacement has been observed as evidenced by increased incidence of bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).</paragraph>

Clear-cut clinical evidence of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus should be present, such as respiratory distress, a continuous murmur, a hyperactive precordium, cardiomegaly and pulmonary plethora on chest x-ray.</paragraph>

However, minor gastrointestinal bleeding (i.e., chemical detection of blood in the stool) was more commonly noted in those neonates treated with indomethacin. Severe gastrointestinal effects have been reported in adults with various arthritic disorders treated chronically with oral indomethacin.

Because indomethacin may inhibit platelet aggregation, the potential for intraventricular bleeding may be increased. However, in the large multicenter study of indomethacin for injection (see <linkHtml href="#ID296">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>), the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage in neonates treated with indomethacin for injection was not significantly higher than in the control neonates.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID308">Indomethacin for injection may cause significant reduction in urine output (50 percent or more) with concomitant elevations of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and reductions in glomerular filtration rate and creatinine clearance. These effects in most neonates are transient, disappearing with cessation of therapy with indomethacin for injection. However, because adequate renal function can depend upon renal prostaglandin synthesis, indomethacin for injection may precipitate renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, especially in neonates with other conditions that may adversely affect renal function (e.g., extracellular volume depletion from any cause, congestive heart failure, sepsis, concomitant use of any nephrotoxic drug, hepatic dysfunction). When significant suppression of urine volume occurs after a dose of indomethacin for injection, no additional dose should be given until the urine output returns to normal levels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Indomethacin for injection in pre-term infants may suppress water excretion to a greater extent than sodium excretion. When this occurs, a significant reduction in serum sodium values (i.e., hyponatremia) may result. Neonates should have serum electrolyte determinations done during therapy with indomethacin for injection. Renal function and serum electrolytes should be monitored (see <linkHtml href="#ID309">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID312">Drug Interactions </linkHtml>and <linkHtml href="#ID318">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID313">Since renal function may be reduced by indomethacin for injection, consideration should be given to reduction in dosage of those medications that rely on adequate renal function for their elimination. Because the half-life of digitalis (given frequently to pre-term infants with patent ductus arteriosus and associated cardiac failure) may be prolonged when given concomitantly with indomethacin, the neonate should be observed closely; frequent ECGs and serum digitalis levels may be required to prevent or detect digitalis toxicity early. Furthermore, in one study of premature infants treated with indomethacin for injection and also receiving either gentamicin or amikacin, both peak and trough levels of these aminoglycosides were significantly elevated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Therapy with indomethacin may blunt the natriuretic effect of furosemide. This response has been attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In a study of 19 premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus treated with either indomethacin for injection alone or a combination of indomethacin for injection and furosemide, results showed that neonates receiving both indomethacin for injection and furosemide had significantly higher urinary output, higher levels of sodium and chloride excretion, and higher glomerular filtration rates than did those receiving indomethacin for injection alone. In this study, the data suggested that therapy with furosemide helped to maintain renal function in the premature infant when indomethacin for injection was added to the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Indomethacin usually does not influence the hypoprothrombinemia produced by anticoagulants. When indomethacin is added to anticoagulants, prothrombin time should be monitored closely. In post marketing experience, bleeding has been reported in patients on concomitant treatment with anticoagulants and indomethacin for injection.  Caution should be exercised when indomethacin for injection and anticoagulants are administered concomitantly.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In some patients with compromised renal function, the co-administration of an NSAID and an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II antagonist may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.</paragraph>

An increased incidence of neuronal necrosis in the diencephalon in the live-born fetuses was observed. At 2.0 mg/kg/day, no increase in neuronal necrosis was observed as compared to the control groups. Administration of 0.5 or 4.0 mg/kg/day during the first three days of life did not cause an increase in neuronal necrosis at either dose level.</paragraph>

Benzyl alcohol as a preservative has been associated with toxicity in neonates. Therefore, all diluents should be preservative-free. If 1 mL of diluent is used, the concentration of indomethacin in the solution will equal approximately 0.1 mg/0.1 mL; if 2 mL of diluent are used, the concentration of the solution will equal approximately 0.05 mg/0.1 mL. Any unused portion of the solution should be discarded because there is no preservative contained in the vial. A fresh solution should be prepared just prior to each administration. Once reconstituted, the indomethacin solution may be injected intravenously. While the optimal rate of injection has not been established, published literature suggests an infusion rate over 20-30 minutes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Indomethacin for injection is not buffered. Further dilution with intravenous infusion solutions is not recommended.</paragraph>
