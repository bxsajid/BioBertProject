                  <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM1"/>C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>8</sub>F<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>M.W. 250.20
<paragraph>Diflunisal is a stable, white, crystalline compound with a melting point of 
211° to 213°C. It is practically insoluble in water at neutral or acidic pH. 
Because it is an organic acid, it dissolves readily in dilute alkali to give a 
moderately stable solution at room temperature. It is soluble in most organic 
solvents including ethanol, methanol, and acetone.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 500 mg diflunisal. In 
addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: 
croscarmellose sodium, FD&amp;C Blue #2 aluminum lake, hypromellose, 
microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, propylene glycol, sodium 
stearyl fumarate, and titanium dioxide.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Action<paragraph>Diflunisal is a non-steroidal drug with analgesic, 
anti‑inflammatory and antipyretic properties. It is a peripherally‑acting 
non‑narcotic analgesic drug. Habituation, tolerance, and addiction have not been 
reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diflunisal is a difluorophenyl derivative of salicylic acid. Chemically, 
diflunisal differs from aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in two respects. The 
first of these two is the presence of a difluorophenyl substituent at carbon 1. 
The second difference is the removal of the <content styleCode="italics">O</content>‑acetyl 
group from the carbon 4 position. Diflunisal is not metabolized to salicylic 
acid, and the fluorine atoms are not displaced from the difluorophenyl ring 
structure.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The precise mechanism of the analgesic and anti‑inflammatory actions of 
diflunisal is not known. Diflunisal is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. In 
animals, prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of 
bradykinin in inducing pain. Since prostaglandins are known to be among the 
mediators of pain and inflammation, the mode of action of diflunisal may be due 
to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism<paragraph>Diflunisal is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral 
administration with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 2 to 3 hours. 
The drug is excreted in the urine as two soluble glucuronide conjugates 
accounting for about 90% of the administered dose. Little or no diflunisal is 
excreted in the feces. Diflunisal appears in human milk in concentrations of 2 
to 7% of those in plasma. More than 99% of diflunisal in plasma is bound to 
proteins.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>As is the case with salicylic acid, concentration‑dependent pharmacokinetics 
prevail when diflunisal is administered; a doubling of dosage produces a greater 
than doubling of drug accumulation. The effect becomes more apparent with 
repetitive doses. Following single doses, peak plasma concentrations of 41 ± 11 
mcg/mL (mean ± S.D.) were observed following 250 mg doses, 87 ± 17 mcg/mL were 
observed following 500 mg and 124 ± 11 mcg/mL following single 1000 mg doses. 
However, following administration of 250 mg b.i.d., a mean peak level of 56 ± 14 
mcg/mL was observed on day 8, while the mean peak level after 500 mg b.i.d. for 
11 days was 190 ± 33 mcg/mL. In contrast to salicylic acid which has a plasma 
half‑life of 2 1/2 hours, the plasma half‑life of diflunisal is 3 to 4 times 
longer (8 to 12 hours), because of a difluorophenyl substituent at carbon 1. 
Because of its long half‑life and nonlinear pharmacokinetics, several days are 
required for diflunisal plasma levels to reach steady state following multiple 
doses. For this reason, an initial loading dose is necessary to shorten the time 
to reach steady-state levels, and 2 to 3 days of observation are necessary for 
evaluating changes in treatment regimens if a loading dose is not used.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies in baboons to determine passage across the blood‑brain barrier have 
shown that only small quantities of diflunisal, under normal or acidotic 
conditions are transported into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The ratio of 
blood/CSF concentrations after intravenous doses of 50 mg/kg or oral doses of 
100 mg/kg of diflunisal was 100:1. In contrast, oral doses of 500 mg/kg of 
aspirin resulted in a blood/CSF ratio of 5:1.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Mild to Moderate Pain<paragraph>Diflunisal is a peripherally‑acting analgesic agent with a long 
duration of action. Diflunisal produces significant analgesia within 1 hour and 
maximum analgesia within 2 to 3 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Consistent with its long half‑life, clinical effects of diflunisal mirror its 
pharmacokinetic behavior, which is the basis for recommending a loading dose 
when instituting therapy. Patients treated with diflunisal, on the first dose, 
tend to have a slower onset of pain relief when compared with drugs achieving 
comparable peak effects. However, diflunisal produces longer lasting responses 
than the comparative agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Comparative single dose clinical studies have established the analgesic 
efficacy of diflunisal at various dose levels relative to other analgesics. 
Analgesic effect measurements were derived from hourly evaluations by patients 
during eight and twelve hour postdosing observation periods. The following 
information may serve as a guide for prescribing diflunisal.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diflunisal 500 mg was comparable in analgesic efficacy to aspirin 650 mg, 
acetaminophen 600 mg or 650 mg, and acetaminophen 650 mg with propoxyphene 
napsylate 100 mg. Patients treated with diflunisal had longer lasting responses 
than the patients treated with the comparative analgesics.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diflunisal 1000 mg was comparable in analgesic efficacy to acetaminophen 600 
mg with codeine 60 mg. Patients treated with diflunisal had longer lasting 
responses than the patients who received acetaminophen with codeine.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A loading dose of 1000 mg provides faster onset of pain relief, shorter time 
to peak analgesic effect, and greater peak analgesic effect than an initial 500 
mg dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In contrast to the comparative analgesics, a significantly greater proportion 
of patients treated with diflunisal did not remedicate and continued to have a 
good analgesic effect eight to twelve hours after dosing. Seventy‑five percent 
(75%) of patients treated with diflunisal continued to have a good analgesic 
response at four hours. When patients having a good analgesic response at four 
hours were followed, 78% of these patients continued to have a good analgesic 
response at eight hours and 64% at twelve hours.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Chronic Anti-Inflammatory Therapy in Osteoarthritis and 
Rheumatoid Arthritis<paragraph>In the controlled, double‑blind clinical trials in which 
diflunisal (500 mg to 1000 mg a day) was compared with anti‑inflammatory doses 
of aspirin (2 to 4 grams a day), patients treated with diflunisal had a 
significantly lower incidence of tinnitus and of adverse effects involving the 
gastrointestinal system than patients treated with aspirin (see also <content styleCode="bold">Effect on Fecal Blood Loss</content>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Osteoarthritis<paragraph>The effectiveness of diflunisal for the treatment of 
osteoarthritis was studied in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or 
knee. The activity of diflunisal was demonstrated by clinical improvement in the 
signs and symptoms of disease activity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a double‑blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration in which dosages 
were adjusted according to patient response, diflunisal 500 or 750 mg daily was 
shown to be comparable in effectiveness to aspirin 2000 or 3000 mg daily. In 
open‑label extensions of this study to 24 or 48 weeks, diflunisal continued to 
show similar effectiveness and generally was well tolerated.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Rheumatoid Arthritis<paragraph>In controlled clinical trials, the effectiveness of diflunisal 
was established for both acute exacerbations and long‑term management of 
rheumatoid arthritis. The activity of diflunisal was demonstrated by clinical 
improvement in the signs and symptoms of disease activity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a double‑blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration in which dosages 
were adjusted according to patient response, diflunisal 500 or 750 mg daily was 
comparable in effectiveness to aspirin 2600 or 3900 mg daily. In open‑label 
extensions of this study to 52 weeks, diflunisal continued to be effective and 
was generally well tolerated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diflunisal 500, 750, or 1000 mg daily was compared with aspirin 2000, 3000, 
or 4000 mg daily in a multicenter study of 8 weeks' duration in which dosages 
were adjusted according to patient response. In this study, diflunisal was 
comparable in efficacy to aspirin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a double‑blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration in which dosages 
were adjusted according to patient needs, diflunisal 500 or 750 mg daily and 
ibuprofen 1600 or 2400 mg daily were comparable in effectiveness and 
tolerability.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a double‑blind multicenter study of 12 weeks' duration, diflunisal 750 mg 
daily was comparable in efficacy to naproxen 750 mg daily. The incidence of 
gastrointestinal adverse effects and tinnitus was comparable for both drugs. 
This study was extended to 48 weeks on an open‑label basis. Diflunisal continued 
to be effective and generally well tolerated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diflunisal and gold salts may be used 
in combination at their usual dosage levels. In clinical studies, diflunisal 
added to the regimen of gold salts usually resulted in additional symptomatic 
relief but did not alter the course of the underlying disease.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Antipyretic Activity<paragraph>Diflunisal tablets are not recommended for use as an antipyretic 
agent. In single 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg doses, diflunisal produced measurable 
but not clinically useful decreases in temperature in patients with fever; 
however, the possibility that it may mask fever in some patients, particularly 
with chronic or high doses, should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Uricosuric Effect<paragraph>In normal volunteers, an increase in the renal clearance of uric 
acid and a decrease in serum uric acid was observed when diflunisal was 
administered at 500 mg or 750 mg daily in divided doses. Patients on long‑term 
therapy taking diflunisal at 500 mg to 1000 mg daily in divided doses showed a 
prompt and consistent reduction across studies in mean serum uric acid levels, 
which were lowered as much as 1.4 mg%. It is not known whether diflunisal 
interferes with the activity of other uricosuric agents.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Effect on Platelet Function<paragraph>As an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase, diflunisal has a 
dose‑related effect on platelet function and bleeding time. In normal 
volunteers, 250 mg b.i.d. for 8 days had no effect on platelet function, and 500 
mg b.i.d., the usual recommended dose, had a slight effect. At 1000 mg b.i.d., 
which exceeds the maximum recommended dosage, however, diflunisal inhibited 
platelet function. In contrast to aspirin, these effects of diflunisal were 
reversible, because of the absence of the chemically labile and biologically 
reactive <content styleCode="italics">O</content>‑acetyl group at the carbon 4 position. 
Bleeding time was not altered by a dose of 250 mg b.i.d., and was only slightly 
increased at 500 mg b.i.d. At 1000 mg b.i.d., a greater increase occurred, but 
was not statistically significantly different from the change in the placebo 
group.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Effect on Fecal Blood Loss<paragraph>When diflunisal was given to normal volunteers at the usual 
recommended dose of 500 mg twice daily, fecal blood loss was not significantly 
different from placebo. Aspirin at 1000 mg four times daily produced the 
expected increase in fecal blood loss. Diflunisal at 1000 mg twice daily (NOTE: 
exceeds the recommended dosage) caused a statistically significant increase in 
fecal blood loss, but this increase was only one‑half as large as that 
associated with aspirin 1300 mg twice daily.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Effect on Blood Glucose<paragraph>Diflunisal did not affect fasting blood sugar in diabetic 
patients who were receiving tolbutamide or placebo.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <content styleCode="bold">GI WARNINGS</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <content styleCode="bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</content>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs, including diflunisal tablets, can lead to onset of new 
hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may 
contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or 
loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. 
NSAIDs, including diflunisal tablets, should be used with caution in patients 
with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the 
initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<paragraph>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients 
taking NSAIDs. Diflunisal tablets should be used with caution in patients with 
fluid retention or heart failure.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and 
Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including diflunisal tablets, can cause serious 
gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, 
ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, 
which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or 
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five 
patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is 
symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs 
occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 
to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer 
duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at 
some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not 
without risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding </content>who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. 
Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with 
NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer 
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general 
health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, patients who are volume 
depleted, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed 
by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies 
regarding the use of diflunisal tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. 
Therefore, treatment with diflunisal tablets is not recommended in these 
patients with advanced renal disease. If diflunisal tablet therapy must be 
initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions may 
occur in patients without known prior exposure to diflunisal tablets. Diflunisal 
tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom 
complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or 
without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm 
after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see <content styleCode="bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS 
</content>and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content>,<content styleCode="bold"> Preexisting 
Asthma</content>). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactic/ 
anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including diflunisal tablets, can cause serious skin 
adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events 
may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and 
symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be 
discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of 
hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypersensitivity Syndrome<paragraph>A potentially life-threatening, apparent hypersensitivity 
syndrome has been reported. This multisystem syndrome includes constitutional 
symptoms (fever, chills), and cutaneous findings (see <content styleCode="bold">ADVERSE 
REACTIONS</content>, <content styleCode="bold">Dermatologic</content>). It may also include 
involvement of major organs (changes in liver function, jaundice, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal 
impairment, including renal failure), and less specific findings (adenitis, 
arthralgia, myalgia, arthritis, malaise, anorexia, disorientation). If evidence 
of hypersensitivity occurs, therapy with diflunisal tablets should be 
discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diflunisal tablets 
should be avoided because they may cause premature closure of the ductus 
arteriosus.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Diflunisal tablets cannot be expected to substitute for 
corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation 
of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is 
made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of diflunisal tablets in reducing fever and 
inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting 
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including diflunisal tablets. These laboratory 
abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with 
continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or 
more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of 
patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe 
hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver 
necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been 
reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with diflunisal 
tablets. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, 
or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), diflunisal 
tablets should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
diflunisal tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood 
loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on 
long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diflunisal tablets, should have their 
hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of 
anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
diflunisal tablets who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet 
function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving 
anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diflunisal tablets should 
not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should 
be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Ocular Effects<paragraph>Because of reports of adverse eye findings with agents of this 
class, it is recommended that patients who develop eye complaints during 
treatment with diflunisal tablets have ophthalmologic studies.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Reye’s Syndrome<paragraph>Acetylsalicylic acid has been associated with Reye’s syndrome. 
Because diflunisal is a derivative of salicylic acid, the possibility of its 
association with Reye’s syndrome cannot be excluded.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Information for Patients<paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Patients should be informed of the following 
information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the 
course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID 
Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.</content>

such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. 
Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should 
be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, 
weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing 
any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance 
of this follow-up (see ).

                     <item>Diflunisal tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, 
serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in 
hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and 
a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
diflunisal tablets should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Drug Interactions<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Anagonists<paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive 
effect of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. These interactions 
should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with 
ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists. In some patients with compromised 
renal function, the coadministration of an NSAID and an ACE-inhibitor or an 
angiotensin II antagonist may result in further deterioration of renal function, 
including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Acetaminophen<paragraph>In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal 
and acetaminophen resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of 
acetaminophen. Acetaminophen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal. Since 
acetaminophen in high doses has been associated with hepatotoxicity, concomitant 
administration of diflunisal tablets and acetaminophen should be used 
cautiously, with careful monitoring of patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen in dogs, but not 
in rats, at approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human therapeutic dose 
of each (40 to 52 mg/kg/day of diflunisal/acetaminophen), resulted in greater 
gastrointestinal toxicity than when either drug was administered alone. The 
clinical significance of these findings has not been established.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Antacids<paragraph>Concomitant administration of antacids may reduce plasma levels 
of diflunisal. This effect is small with occasional doses of antacids, but may 
be clinically significant when antacids are used on a continuous schedule.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Aspirin<paragraph>When diflunisal is administered with aspirin, its protein binding 
is reduced, although the clearance of free diflunisal is not altered. The 
clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other 
NSAIDs, concomitant administration of diflunisal tablets and aspirin is not 
generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In normal volunteers, a small decrease in diflunisal levels was observed when 
multiple doses of diflunisal and aspirin were administered concomitantly.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cyclosporine<paragraph>Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in 
cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal 
prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking 
cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diuretics<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have 
shown that diflunisal can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and 
thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of 
renal prostaglandin synthesis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal and 
hydrochlorothiazide resulted in significantly increased plasma levels of 
hydrochlorothiazide. Diflunisal decreased the hyperuricemic effect of 
hydrochlorothiazide. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should 
be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>, <content styleCode="bold">Renal Effects</content>), as well as 
to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Lithium<paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These 
effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by 
the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects 
should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Methotrexate<paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance 
the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>NSAIDs<paragraph>The administration of diflunisal to normal volunteers receiving 
indomethacin decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the 
plasma levels of indomethacin. In some patients the combined use of indomethacin 
and diflunisal has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
Therefore, indomethacin and diflunisal tablets should not be used 
concomitantly.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The concomitant use of diflunisal tablets and other NSAIDs is not recommended 
due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no 
increase in efficacy. The following information was obtained from studies in 
normal volunteers.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Sulindac<paragraph>The concomitant administration of diflunisal and sulindac in 
normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active 
sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Naproxen<paragraph>The concomitant administration of diflunisal and naproxen in 
normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but 
significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide 
metabolite. Naproxen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Oral Anticoagulants<paragraph>In some normal volunteers, the concomitant administration of 
diflunisal and warfarin, acenocoumarol, or phenprocoumon resulted in 
prolongation of prothrombin time. This may occur because diflunisal 
competitively displaces coumarins from protein binding sites. Accordingly, when 
diflunisal tablets are administered with oral anticoagulants, the prothrombin 
time should be closely monitored during and for several days after concomitant 
drug administration. Adjustment of dosage of oral anticoagulants may be 
required. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, 
such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher 
than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Tolbutamide<paragraph>In diabetic patients receiving diflunisal and tolbutamide, no 
significant effects were seen on tolbutamide plasma levels or fasting blood 
glucose.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Serum Salicylate Assays<paragraph>Caution should be used in interpreting the results of serum 
salicylate assays when diflunisal is present. Salicylate levels have been found 
to be falsely elevated with some assay methods.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
Fertility<paragraph>Diflunisal did not affect the type or incidence of neoplasia in a 
105 week study in the rat given doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 
approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended human dose), or in long‑term 
carcinogenic studies in mice given diflunisal at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day 
(equivalent to approximately 2.7 times the maximum recommended human dose). It 
was concluded that there was no carcinogenic potential for diflunisal.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diflunisal passes the placental barrier to a minor degree in the rat. 
Diflunisal had no mutagenic activity after oral administration in the dominant 
lethal assay, in the Ames microbial mutagen test or in the V‑79 Chinese hamster 
lung cell assay.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>No evidence of impaired fertility was found in reproduction studies in rats 
at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Teratogenic Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy category C<paragraph>A dose of 60 mg/kg/day of diflunisal (equivalent to two times the 
maximum human dose) was maternotoxic, embryotoxic, and teratogenic in rabbits. 
In three of six studies in rabbits, evidence of teratogenicity was observed at 
doses ranging from 40 to 50 mg/kg/day. Teratology studies in mice, at doses up 
to 45 mg/kg/day, and in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, revealed no harm to 
the fetus due to diflunisal. Aspirin and other salicylates have been shown to be 
teratogenic in a wide variety of species, including the rat and rabbit, at doses 
ranging from 50 to 400 mg/kg/day (approximately one to eight times the human 
dose). Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. 
There are no adequate and well controlled studies with diflunisal in pregnant 
women. Diflunisal tablets should be used in pregnancy only if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nonteratogenic Effects<paragraph>Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use 
during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The known effects of drugs of this class on the human fetus during the third 
trimester of pregnancy include: constriction of the ductus arteriosus 
prenatally, tricuspid incompetence, and pulmonary hypertension; non-closure of 
the ductus arteriosus postnatally which may be resistant to medical management; 
myocardial degenerative changes, platelet dysfunction with resultant bleeding, 
intracranial bleeding, renal dysfunction or failure, renal injury/dysgenesis 
which may result in prolonged or permanent renal failure, oligohydramnios, 
gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and increased risk of necrotizing 
enterocolitis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In rats at a dose of one and one-half times the maximum human dose, there was 
an increase in the average length of gestation. Similar increases in the length 
of gestation have been observed with aspirin, indomethacin, and phenylbutazone, 
and may be related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Labor and Delivery<paragraph>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed 
parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of diflunisal 
tablets on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>Diflunisal is excreted in human milk in concentrations of 2 to 7% 
of those in plasma. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
nursing infants from diflunisal, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the 
importance of the drug to the mother.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pediatric Use<paragraph>Safety and effectiveness of diflunisal in pediatric patients 
below the age of 12 have not been established. Use of diflunisal tablets in 
pediatric patients below the age of 12 is not recommended.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The adverse effects observed following diflunisal administration to neonatal 
animals appear to be species, age, and dose-dependent. At dose levels 
approximately 3 times the usual human therapeutic dose, both aspirin (200 to 400 
mg/kg/day) and diflunisal (80 mg/kg/day) resulted in death, leukocytosis, weight 
loss, and bilateral cataracts in neonatal (4 to 5-day-old) beagle puppies after 
2 to 10 doses. Administration of an 80 mg/kg/day dose of diflunisal to 
25-day-old puppies resulted in lower mortality, and did not produce cataracts. 
In newborn rats, a 400 mg/kg/day dose of aspirin resulted in increased mortality 
and some cataracts, whereas the effects of diflunisal administration at doses up 
to 140 mg/kg/day were limited to a decrease in average body weight gain.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Use<paragraph>As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the 
elderly (65 years and older) since advancing age appears to increase the 
possibility of adverse reactions. Elderly patients seem to tolerate ulceration 
or bleeding less well than other individuals and many spontaneous reports of 
fatal GI events are in this population (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>, 
<content styleCode="bold">Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and 
Perforation</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of 
toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal 
function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor 
renal function (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>, <content styleCode="bold">Renal

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Cases of overdosage have occurred and deaths have been reported. 
Most patients recovered without evidence of permanent sequelae. The most common 
signs and symptoms observed with overdosage were drowsiness, vomiting, nausea, 
diarrhea, hyperventilation, tachycardia, sweating, tinnitus, disorientation, 
stupor, and coma. Diminished urine output and cardiorespiratory arrest have also 
been reported. The lowest dosage of diflunisal at which a death has been 
reported was 15 grams without the presence of other drugs. In a mixed drug 
overdose, ingestion of 7.5 grams of diflunisal resulted in death.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the event of overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by inducing 
vomiting or by gastric lavage, and the patient carefully observed and given 
symptomatic and supportive treatment. Because of the high degree of protein 
binding, hemodialysis may not be effective.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The oral LD<sub>50</sub> of the drug is 500 mg/kg and 826 mg/kg 
in female mice and female rats, respectively.</paragraph>

               <title>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diflunisal 
tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diflunisal tablets. 
Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with 
individual patient treatment goals (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with diflunisal tablets, the 
dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Concentration‑dependent pharmacokinetics prevail when diflunisal is 
administered; a doubling of dosage produces a greater than doubling of drug 
accumulation. The effect becomes more apparent with repetitive doses.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For mild to moderate pain, an initial dose of 1000 mg followed by 500 mg 
every 12 hours is recommended for most patients. Following the initial dose, 
some patients may require 500 mg every 8 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A lower dosage may be appropriate depending on such factors as pain severity, 
patient response, weight, or advanced age; for example, 500 mg initially, 
followed by 250 mg every 8 to 12 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, the suggested dosage range is 
500 mg to 1000 mg daily in two divided doses. The dosage of diflunisal may be 
increased or decreased according to patient response.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Maintenance doses higher than 1500 mg a day are not recommended.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Tablets should be swallowed whole, not crushed or chewed.</paragraph>
