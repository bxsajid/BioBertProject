                     <title>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium
</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). In pharmacologic studies, diclofenac sodium has shown anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium, like other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium is completely absorbed from the GI tract after fasting, oral administration. The diclofenac sodium in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is in a pharmaceutical formulation that resists dissolution in the low pH of gastric fluid but allows a rapid release of drug in the higher pH environment of the duodenum. Only 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available due to first pass metabolism. Peak plasma levels are achieved in 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours), and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) is dose proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy-diclofenac.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Plasma concentrations of diclofenac sodium decline from peak levels in a biexponential fashion, with the terminal phase having a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Clearance and volume of distribution are about 350 mL/min and 550 mL/kg, respectively. More than 99% of diclofenac sodium is reversibly bound to human plasma albumin.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5 to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20 to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10 to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10 to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity.

                     <title>Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of misoprostol
</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> analog with gastric antisecretory and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in humans this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Effects on gastric acid secretion</content>: Misoprostol, over the range of 50 to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Orally administered misoprostol is rapidly and extensively absorbed, and it undergoes rapid metabolism to its biologically active metabolite, misoprostol acid. Misoprostol acid in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets reaches a maximum plasma concentration in about 20 minutes and is, thereafter, quickly eliminated with an elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> of about 30 minutes. There is high variability in plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies, but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose of misoprostol over the range of 200 to 400 mcg. No accumulation of misoprostol acid was found in multiple-dose studies, and plasma steady state was achieved within 2 days. The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After oral administration of radio-labeled misoprostol, about 70% of detected radioactivity appears in the urine. Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food, and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid; this effect does not appear to be clinically important.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine or propranolol given with misoprostol. Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.

                              <paragraph>A 4-week study, comparing plasma level profiles of diclofenac (50 mg bid) in younger (26 to 46 years) versus older (66 to 81 years) adults, did not show differences between age groups (10 patients per age group). In a multiple-dose (bid) crossover study of 24 people aged 65 years or older, the misoprostol contained in diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium.
</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac have not been detected in studies of patients with renal (50 mg intravenously) or hepatic impairment (100 mg oral solution). In patients with renal impairment (N=5, creatinine clearance 3 to 42 mL/min), AUC values and elimination rates were comparable to those in healthy people. In patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis (variably elevated transaminases and mildly elevated bilirubins, N=10), diclofenac concentrations and urinary elimination values were comparable to those in healthy people.
</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Pharmacokinetic studies with misoprostol in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of t<sub>1/2</sub>, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC compared to healthy people. In people over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased.
</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a study of people with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, mean misoprostol acid AUC and C<sub>max</sub> showed approximately double the mean values obtained in healthy people. Three people who had the lowest antipyrine and lowest indocyanine green clearance values had the highest misoprostol acid AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values.
</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk. The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/mL (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/mL (CV 77%) after single 200 μg and 600 μg misoprostol administration, respectively. The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to &lt; 1 pg/mL at 5 hours post-dose.

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered qid, tid or bid, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in OA and RA patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The tid regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg qid with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given bid was less effective than 200 mcg given tid or qid. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see <linkHtml href="#t2">Table 2</linkHtml>).

</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain diclofenac. Diclofenac metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The extent to which the metabolites may accumulate in patients with renal failure has not been studied. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

                     <title>Hepatic Effects
</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of ALT (SGPT, more than 3 times the ULN [ULN= the upper limit of the normal range]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elevations of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy with diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Borderline elevations (i.e., less than 3 times the ULN), or greater elevations of transaminases occurred in about 15% of diclofenac-treated patients. Of the markers of hepatic function, ALT (SGPT) is recommended for the monitoring of liver injury.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) (ALT was not measured in all studies) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment. In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., more than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (&gt;8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. In another clinical trial where over 17,000 patients received diclofenac for a mean of 18 months, hepatitis was rarely observed.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and usually occur within 1 to 6 months,  but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between transaminase measurements, physicians should inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms), and the appropriate action patients should take if these signs and symptoms appear.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Caution should be exercised in prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics).

                        <paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactic reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see <content styleCode="bold">

Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactic reaction occurs. Allergic reactions have been reported by less than 0.1% of patients who received diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in clinical trials, and there have been rare reports of anaphylaxis in the marketed use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets outside of the United States.

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.

                        <paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

                        <paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed on rare occasions in patients on diclofenac therapy. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs or symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on diclofenac, the possibility of it being related to diclofenac should be considered.

                        <paragraph>The use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with hepatic porphyria should be avoided. To date, one patient has been described in whom diclofenac sodium probably triggered a clinical attack of porphyria. The postulated mechanism, demonstrated in rats, for causing such attacks by diclofenac sodium, as well as some other NSAIDs, is through stimulation of the porphyrin precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA).

Statistically significant changes in prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times have been reported in normal volunteers. The mean changes were observed to be less than 1 second in both instances, however, and are unlikely to be clinically important. Diclofenac sodium is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, however, and all drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis interfere with platelet function to some degree; therefore, patients who may be adversely affected by such an action should be carefully observed. Misoprostol has not been shown to exacerbate the effects of diclofenac on platelet activity.

                              <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium does not alter glucose metabolism in healthy people nor does it alter the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents. There are rare reports, however, from marketing experience, of changes in effects of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of diclofenac sodium that necessitated change in the doses of such agents. Both hypo- and hyperglycemic effects have been reported. A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that diclofenac sodium may alter a diabetic patient's response to insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.

Ingestion of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may increase cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Patients who begin taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or who increase their dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets while taking cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristic for cyclosporine. They should be observed closely, particularly if renal function is impaired.

                              <paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.

Thus, it is not recommended that diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets be coadministered with magnesium-containing antacids.

An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol.

                        <paragraph>Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets themselves (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol combinations in 250:1 ratio) were not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the rat lymphocyte chromosome aberration test or the mouse micronucleus test.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, oral misoprostol at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 24 times the recommended maximum human dose of 0.6 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral misoprostol at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day), 80 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 1 to 100 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose. These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 24-month rat carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium up to 2 mg/kg/day (12 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day) was not tumorigenic. For a 50-kg person of average height (1.46 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area), this dose represents 0.08 times the recommended maximum human dose (148 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>) on a body surface area basis. In a 24-month mouse carcinogenicity study, oral diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.006 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (3 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.02 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) in females was not tumorigenic. Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.16 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.

                                 </content>. Misoprostol may endanger pregnancy (may cause abortion) and thereby cause harm to the fetus when administered to a pregnant woman. Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe genital bleeding, shock, fetal bradycardia, and fetal and material death have been reported. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contain 200 mcg of misoprostol, are likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete. If a woman is or becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the drug should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, fetal bradycardia, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses.
</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Additionally, because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including the diclofenac sodium component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.

                                 </content>. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug's teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Several reports in the literature associate the use of misoprostol during the first trimester of pregnancy with skull defects, cranial nerve palsies, facial malformations, and limb defects.

                              <paragraph>An oral teratology study has been performed in pregnant rabbits at dose combinations (250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.8 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 0.8 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and has revealed no evidence of teratogenic potential for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets.
</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Oral teratology studies have been performed in pregnant rats at doses up to 1.6 mg/kg/day (9.6 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 16 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and pregnant rabbits at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg/day (12 mg/ m<sup>2</sup>/day, 20 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of teratogenic potential for misoprostol.

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium has been found in the milk of nursing mothers. Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk. There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breastfeeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol. Caution should be exercised when diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are administered to a nursing woman.

                        <paragraph>As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older). Of the more than 2,100 subjects in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 25% were 65 and over, while 6% were 75 and over. In studies with diclofenac, 31% of subjects were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see <content styleCode="bold">

</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based on studies in the elderly, no adjustment of the dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is necessary in the elderly for pharmacokinetic reasons (see <linkHtml href="#s6">Pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets</linkHtml>—<content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding coadministration with magnesium-containing antacids.

                        <paragraph>Clinical signs that may suggest diclofenac sodium overdose include GI complaints, confusion, drowsiness or general hypotonia. Reports of overdosage with diclofenac cover 66 cases. In approximately one-half of these reports of overdosage, concomitant medications were also taken. The highest dose of diclofenac was 5.0 g in a 17-year-old man who suffered loss of consciousness, increased intracranial pressure, and aspiration pneumonitis, and died 2 days after overdose. A 24-year-old woman who took 4.0 g and the 28- and 42-year-old women, each of whom took 3.75 g, did not develop any clinically significant signs or symptoms. However, there was a report of a 17-year-old woman who experienced vomiting and drowsiness after an overdose of 2.37 g of diclofenac.

                        <paragraph>Animal studies show a wide range of susceptibilities to acute overdosage, with primates being more resistant to acute toxicity than rodents (LD50 in mg/kg: rats, 55; dogs, 500; monkeys, 3200).

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Symptoms of overdosage with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be treated with supportive therapy. In case of acute overdosage, gastric lavage is recommended. Induced diuresis may be beneficial because diclofenac sodium and misoprostol metabolites are excreted in the urine. The effect of dialysis or hemoperfusion on the elimination of diclofenac sodium (99% protein bound) and misoprostol acid remains unproven. The use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol.

For patients who experience intolerance, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75/0.2 mg bid or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50/0.2 mg bid can be used, but are less effective in preventing ulcers. This fixed combination product, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, is not recommended for patients who would not receive the appropriate dose of both ingredients.

                              <linkHtml href="#s8">CLINICAL STUDIES</linkHtml>
                           </content>). For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg qid and tid regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the bid regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the qid regimen is more protective than the tid or bid regimens. However, the qid regimen is less well tolerated than the tid regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose (see <content styleCode="bold">
                              <linkHtml href="#s61">ADVERSE REACTIONS— Gastrointestinal</linkHtml>
                           </content>), and the bid regimen may be better tolerated than tid in some patients.
</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac), after which the patient may be changed to the appropriate dose of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, or use of the individual components to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. The total dose of misoprostol should not exceed 800 mcg/day, and no more than 200 mcg of misoprostol should be administered at any one time. Doses of diclofenac higher than 150 mg/day in osteoarthritis or higher than 225 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis are not recommended.

                        <paragraph>For additional information, it may be helpful to refer to the package inserts for misoprostol immediate release tablets and diclofenac sodium delayed release tablets.

                  <paragraph>Read this leaflet before taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (diclofenac sodium 50 or 75 mg/misoprostol 200 mcg) and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed.

                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are being prescribed by your doctor for treatment of your arthritis symptoms while at the same time providing protection from the development of stomach and intestinal ulcers due to the arthritis medication. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain diclofenac, an arthritis medication. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets also contain misoprostol to decrease the chance of getting stomach and intestinal ulcers that sometimes develop with NSAID medications. Serious side effects are still possible, however, and you should report to your doctor any signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding, skin rash, weight gain or swelling. If signs of liver toxicity occur (nausea, fatigue, lethargy, itching, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms), you should stop therapy and seek immediate medical attention.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If signs of an anaphylactic reaction occur (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat), you should stop therapy and seek immediate medical attention (see <content styleCode="bold">

                     </content>). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contain diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol has been reported to cause the uterus to rupture (tear) when given after the eighth week of pregnancy. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you become pregnant during therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, stop taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and contact your doctor immediately. Remember that even if you are using a means of birth control, it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and consult your doctor immediately.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended for nursing mothers.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, may cause an increased risk of heart attack, or stroke, which can lead to death. This risk may increase with duration of use. If you have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease, you may be at greater risk (see boxed <content styleCode="bold">

                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, may cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI effects such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, upset stomach and/or nausea in some people. In most cases these problems develop during the first few weeks of therapy and stop after about a week with continued treatment. You can minimize possible diarrhea by making sure you take diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with meals and by avoiding the use of antacids containing magnesium (if needed, use one containing aluminum or calcium instead). Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be swallowed whole, and not chewed, crushed or dissolved.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because these side effects are usually mild to moderate and usually go away in a matter of days, most patients can continue to take diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If you have prolonged difficulty (more than 7 days), or if you have severe diarrhea, cramping and/or nausea, call your doctor.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may also cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can lead to death. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see boxed <content styleCode="bold">

</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, ask for medical advice when observing signs and symptoms of ulceration and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis.

                  <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious skin side effects, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which may result in hospitalization and even death.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, ask for medical advice when observing signs or symptoms, such as skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching. Stop the drug immediately at the first appearance of skin rash or any other signs of hypersensitivity and contact your physician as soon as possible.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Take diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets only according to the directions given by your doctor. Changes in dose should be made only with your doctor's approval.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Do not give diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to anyone else.
