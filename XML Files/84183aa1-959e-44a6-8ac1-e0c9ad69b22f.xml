In the APC (Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib) trial, the hazard ratio for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was 3.4 (95% CI 1.4 – 8.5) for celecoxib 400 mg twice daily and 2.8 (95% CI 1.1 – 7.2) with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily compared to placebo. Cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 3.0% (20/671 subjects) and 2.5% (17/685 subjects), respectively, compared to 0.9% (6/679 subjects) with placebo treatment. The increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebo-treated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.6">Clinical Studies (14.6)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and non-selective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with celecoxib, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV toxicity and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and celecoxib does increase the risk of serious GI events [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.4">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a different COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.2 Hypertension<paragraph>As with all NSAIDs, celecoxib can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including celecoxib, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with celecoxib and throughout the course of therapy. The rates of hypertension from the CLASS trial in the celecoxib, ibuprofen and diclofenac-treated patients were 2.4%, 4.2% and 2.5%, respectively [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.6">Clinical Studies (14.6)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.3 Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<paragraph>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs, including celecoxib [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]. In the CLASS study [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.6">Clinical Studies (14.6)</linkHtml>], the Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months of peripheral edema in patients on celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 4.5%, 6.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Celecoxib should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.4 Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects<paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can cause serious gastrointestinal events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.6">Clinical Studies (14.6)</linkHtml>]. With longer duration of use of NSAIDs, there is a trend for increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Physicians and patients should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during celecoxib therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with active GI bleeding.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.5 Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver-associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including celecoxib [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]. In controlled clinical trials of celecoxib, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for celecoxib and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking celecoxib and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with celecoxib. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), celecoxib should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.6 Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Clinical trials with celecoxib have shown renal effects similar to those observed with comparator NSAIDs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with celecoxib is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If celecoxib therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.7 Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with NSAIDs in general, anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients without known prior exposure to celecoxib. In post-marketing experience, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported in patients receiving celecoxib. Celecoxib should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.7">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</linkHtml>]. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.8 Skin Reactions<paragraph>Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events can occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.9 Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, starting at 30 weeks gestation, celecoxib should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S8.1">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.10 Corticosteroid Treatment<paragraph>Celecoxib cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.11 Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving celecoxib. In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with celecoxib and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with celecoxib should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. Celecoxib does not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and does not inhibit platelet aggregation at indicated dosages [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.12 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)<paragraph>Celecoxib should be used only with caution in pediatric patients with systemic onset JRA due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.13 Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.14 Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, celecoxib should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.15 Inflammation<paragraph>The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>5.16 Concomitant NSAID Use<paragraph>The concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Of the celecoxib-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of celecoxib of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received celecoxib at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Hematological Events: The incidence of clinically significant decreases in hemoglobin (&gt;2 g/dL) was lower in patients on celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (0.5%) compared to patients on either diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (1.3%) or ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily 1.9%. The lower incidence of events with celecoxib was maintained with or without ASA use [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawals/Serious Adverse Events: Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates at 9 months for withdrawals due to adverse events for celecoxib, diclofenac and ibuprofen were 24%, 29%, and 26%, respectively. Rates for serious adverse events (i.e., causing hospitalization or felt to be life-threatening or otherwise medically significant), regardless of causality, were not different across treatment groups (8%, 7%, and 8%, respectively).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>6.3 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis Study<paragraph>In a 12-week, double-blind, active-controlled study, 242 JRA patients 2 years to 17 years of age were treated with celecoxib or naproxen; 77 JRA patients were treated with celecoxib 3 mg/kg BID, 82 patients were treated with celecoxib 6 mg/kg BID, and 83 patients were treated with naproxen 7.5 mg/kg BID. The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse events in celecoxib treated patients were headache, fever (pyrexia), upper abdominal pain, cough, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, nausea, arthralgia, diarrhea and vomiting. The most commonly occurring (≥5%) adverse experiences for naproxen-treated patients were headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, abdominal pain, and dizziness (Table 2). Compared with naproxen, celecoxib at doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg BID had no observable deleterious effect on growth and development during the course of the 12-week double-blind study. There was no substantial difference in the number of clinical exacerbations of uveitis or systemic features of JRA among treatment groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 12-week, open-label extension of the double-blind study described above, 202 JRA patients were treated with celecoxib 6 mg/kg BID. The incidence of adverse events was similar to that observed during the double-blind study; no unexpected adverse events of clinical importance emerged.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adverse Events from Ankylosing Spondylitis Studies: A total of 378 patients were treated with celecoxib in placebo- and active-controlled AS studies. Doses up to 400 mg once daily were studied. The types of adverse events reported in the AS studies were similar to those reported in the OA/RAstudies.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adverse Events from Analgesia and Dysmenorrhea Studies: Approximately 1,700 patients were treated with celecoxib in analgesia and dysmenorrhea studies. All patients in post-oral surgery pain studies received a single dose of study medication. Doses up to 600 mg/day of celecoxib were studied in primary dysmenorrhea and post-orthopedic surgery pain studies. The types of adverse events in the analgesia and dysmenorrhea studies were similar to those reported in arthritis studies. The only additional adverse event reported was post-dental extraction alveolar osteitis (dry socket) in the post-oral surgery pain studies.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>General: Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver. Co-administration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 should be done with caution. Significant interactions may occur when celecoxib is administered together with drugs that inhibit CYP2C9.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.1 Warfarin<paragraph>Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days, after initiating or changing celecoxib therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications. The effect of celecoxib on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily 2–5 mg doses of warfarin. In these subjects, celecoxib did not alter the anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, in post-marketing experience, serious bleeding events, some of which were fatal, have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving celecoxib concurrently with warfarin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.2 Lithium<paragraph>In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg twice daily with celecoxib 200 mg twice daily as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when celecoxib is introduced or withdrawn.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.3 Aspirin<paragraph>Celecoxib can be used with low-dose aspirin. However, concomitant administration of aspirin with celecoxib increases the rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of celecoxib alone [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.4">5.4)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.6">Clinical Studies (14.6)</linkHtml>]. Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.4 ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists<paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking celecoxib concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.5 Fluconazole<paragraph>Concomitant administration of fluconazole at 200 mg once daily resulted in a two-fold increase in celecoxib plasma concentration. This increase is due to the inhibition of celecoxib metabolism via P450 2C9 by fluconazole [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]. Celecoxib should be introduced at the lowest recommended dose in patients receiving fluconazole.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.6 Furosemide<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.7 Methotrexate<paragraph>In an interaction study of rheumatoid arthritis patients taking methotrexate, celecoxib did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>7.8 Concomitant NSAID Use<paragraph>The concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregnancy Category C. Pregnancy category D from 30 weeks of gestation onward.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Teratogenic effects: Celecoxib at oral doses ≥150 mg/kg/day (approximately 2-fold human exposure at 200 mg twice daily as measured by AUC0–24), caused an increased incidence of ventricular septal defects, a rare event, and fetal alterations, such as ribs fused, sternebrae fused and sternebrae misshapen when rabbits were treated throughout organogenesis. A dose-dependent increase in diaphragmatic hernias was observed when rats were given celecoxib at oral doses ≥30 mg/kg/day (approximately 6-fold human exposure based on the AUC0–24 at 200 mg twice daily) throughout organogenesis. There are no studies in pregnant women. Celecoxib should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Nonteratogenic effects: Celecoxib produced pre-implantation and post-implantation losses and reduced embryo/fetal survival in rats at oral dosages ≥50 mg/kg/day (approximately 6-fold human exposure based on the AUC0–24 at 200 mg twice daily). These changes are expected with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are not the result of permanent alteration of female reproductive function, nor are they expected at clinical exposures. No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on the closure of the ductus arteriosus in humans. Therefore, use of celecoxib during the third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>8.2 Labor and Delivery<paragraph>Celecoxib produced no evidence of delayed labor or parturition at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg in rats (approximately 7-fold human exposure as measured by the AUC0–24 at 200 mg BID). The effects of celecoxib on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>8.3 Nursing Mothers<paragraph>Limited data from 3 published reports that included a total of 12 breastfeeding women showed low levels of celecoxib in breast milk. The calculated average daily infant dose was 10–40 mcg/kg/day, less than 1% of the weight-based therapeutic dose for a two-year old-child. A report of two breastfed infants 17 and 22 months of age did not show any adverse events. Caution should be exercised when celecoxib is administered to a nursing woman.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>8.4 Pediatric Use<paragraph>Celecoxib is approved for relief of the signs and symptoms of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis in patients 2 years and older. Safety and efficacy have not been studied beyond six months in children. The long-term cardiovascular toxicity in children exposed to celecoxib has not been evaluated and it is unknown if long-term risks may be similar to that seen in adults exposed to celecoxib or other COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs [(see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#BOX">Boxed Warning</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.12">Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</linkHtml>, and <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.3">Clinical Studies (14.3)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The use of celecoxib in patients 2 years to 17 years of age with pauciarticular, polyarticular course JRA or in patients with systemic onset JRA was studied in a 12-week, double-blind, active controlled, pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy study, with a 12-week open-label extension. Celecoxib has not been studied in patients under the age of 2 years, in patients with body weight less than 10 kg (22 lbs), and in patients with active systemic features. Patients with systemic onset JRA (without active systemic features) appear to be at risk for the development of abnormal coagulation laboratory tests. In some patients with systemic onset JRA, both celecoxib and naproxen were associated with mild prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) but not prothrombin time (PT). NSAIDs including celecoxib should be used only with caution in patients with systemic onset JRA, due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patients with systemic onset JRA should be monitored for the development of abnormal coagulation tests [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.12">Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S6.3">Adverse Reactions (6.3)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S13.2">Animal Toxicology (13.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.3">Clinical Studies (14.3)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph/>8.5 Geriatric Use<paragraph>Of the total number of patients who received celecoxib in pre-approval clinical trials, more than 3,300 were 65–74 years of age, while approximately 1,300 additional patients were 75 years and over. No substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. In clinical studies comparing renal function as measured by the GFR, BUN and creatinine, and platelet function as measured by bleeding time and platelet aggregation, the results were not different between elderly and young volunteers. However, as with other NSAIDs, including those that selectively inhibit COX-2, there have been more spontaneous post-marketing reports of fatal GI events and acute renal failure in the elderly than in younger patients [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.4">Warnings and Precautions (5.4</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.6">5.6)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>8.6 Hepatic Insufficiency<paragraph>The daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should be reduced by 50%. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S2.6">Dosage and Administration (2.6)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph/>8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates<paragraph>Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin, phenytoin) should be administered celecoxib with caution. Consider starting treatment at half the lowest recommended dose in poor metabolizers (i.e., CYP2C9*3/*3).

                  <list listType="unordered">
                     <item styleCode="Section">12.1 Mechanism of Action<paragraph>Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of celecoxib is believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, primarily via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and at therapeutic concentrations in humans, celecoxib does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) isoenzyme. In animal colon tumor models, celecoxib reduced the incidence and multiplicity of tumors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>12.2 Pharmacodynamics<paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Platelets: In clinical trials using normal volunteers, celecoxib at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration (higher than recommended therapeutic doses) had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time. Because of its lack of platelet effects, celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. It is not known if there are any effects of celecoxib on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of celecoxib.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Fluid Retention: Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of Henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron. In the collecting ducts, PGE2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>12.3 Pharmacokinetics<paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Absorption: Peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hrs after an oral dose. Under fasting conditions, both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are roughly dose-proportional up to 200 mg BID; at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in Cmax and AUC [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#FE">Food Effects</linkHtml>]. Absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted. With multiple dosing, steady-state conditions are reached on or before Day 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib in a group of healthy subjects are shown in Table 3.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Food Effects: When celecoxib capsules were taken with a high fat meal, peak plasma levels were delayed for about 1 to 2 hours with an increase in total absorption (AUC) of 10% to 20%. Under fasting conditions, at doses above 200 mg, there is less than a proportional increase in Cmax and AUC, which is thought to be due to the low solubility of the drug in aqueous media.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Coadministration of celecoxib with an aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids resulted in a reduction in plasma celecoxib concentrations with a decrease of 37% in Cmax and 10% in AUC. Celecoxib, at doses up to 200 mg twice daily, can be administered without regard to timing of meals. Higher doses (400 mg twice daily) should be administered with food to improve absorption.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy adult volunteers, the overall systemic exposure (AUC) of celecoxib was equivalent when celecoxib was administered as intact capsule or capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce. There were no significant alterations in Cmax, Tmax or t1/2 after administration of capsule contents on applesauce [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S2">Dosage and Administration (2)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Distribution: In healthy subjects, celecoxib is highly protein bound (~97%) within the clinical dose range. In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib binds primarily to albumin and, to a lesser extent, α1-acid glycoprotein. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) is approximately 400 L, suggesting extensive distribution into the tissues. Celecoxib is not preferentially bound to red blood cells.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Metabolism: Celecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via CYP2C9. Three metabolites, a primary alcohol, the corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate, have been identified in human plasma. These metabolites are inactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Excretion: Celecoxib is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism with little (&lt;3%) unchanged drug recovered in the urine and feces. Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug, approximately 57% of the dose was excreted in the feces and 27% was excreted into the urine. The primary metabolite in both urine and feces was the carboxylic acid metabolite (73% of dose) with low amounts of the glucuronide also appearing in the urine. It appears that the low solubility of the drug prolongs the absorption process making terminal half-life (t1/2) determinations more variable. The effective half-life is approximately 11 hours under fasted conditions. The apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) is about 500 mL/min.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Geriatric: At steady state, elderly subjects (over 65 years old) had a 40% higher Cmax and a 50% higher AUC compared to the young subjects. In elderly females, celecoxib Cmax and AUC are higher than those for elderly males, but these increases are predominantly due to lower body weight in elderly females. Dose adjustment in the elderly is not generally necessary. However, for patients of less than 50 kg in body weight, initiate therapy at the lowest recommended dose [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S2.6">Dosage and Administration (2.6)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S8.5">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Pediatric: The steady state pharmacokinetics of celecoxib administered as an investigational oral suspension was evaluated in 152 JRA patients 2 years to 17 years of age weighing ≥10 kg with pauciarticular or polyarticular course JRA and in patients with systemic onset JRA. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the oral clearance (unadjusted for body weight) of celecoxib increases less than proportionally to increasing weight, with 10 kg and 25 kg patients predicted to have 40% and 24% lower clearance, respectively, compared with a 70 kg adult RA patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Twice-daily administration of 50 mg capsules to JRA patients weighing ≥12 to ≤25 kg and 100 mg capsules to JRA patients weighing &gt;25 kg should achieve plasma concentrations similar to those observed in a clinical trial that demonstrated the non-inferiority of celecoxib to naproxen 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</linkHtml>.

                        <paragraph>Race: Meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic studies has suggested an approximately 40% higher AUC of celecoxib in Blacks compared to Caucasians. The cause and clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Hepatic Insufficiency: A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment has shown that steady-state celecoxib AUC is increased about 40% and 180%, respectively, above that seen in healthy control subjects. Therefore, the daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules should be reduced by approximately 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S2.6">Dosage and Administration (2.6)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S8.6">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Renal Insufficiency: In a cross-study comparison, celecoxib AUC was approximately 40% lower in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (GFR 35–60 mL/min) than that seen in subjects with normal renal function. No significant relationship was found between GFR and celecoxib clearance. Patients with severe renal insufficiency have not been studied. Similar to other NSAIDs, celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.6">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>

Limited data from 4 published reports that included a total of 8 subjects with the homozygous CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype showed celecoxib systemic levels that were 3- to 7-fold higher in these subjects compared to subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 or *I/*3 genotypes. The pharmacokinetics of celecoxib have not been evaluated in subjects with other CYP2C9 polymorphisms, such as *2, *5, *6, *9 and *11. It is estimated that the frequency of the homozygous *3/*3 genotype is 0.3% to 1.0% in various ethnic groups.

Celecoxib was evaluated for treatment of the signs and the symptoms of OA of the knee and hip in placebo- and active-controlled clinical trials of up to 12 weeks duration. In patients with OA, treatment with celecoxib 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily resulted in improvement in WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) osteoarthritis index, a composite of pain, stiffness, and functional measures in OA. In three 12-week studies of pain accompanying OA flare, celecoxib doses of 100 mg twice daily and 200 mg twice daily provided significant reduction of pain within 24–48 hours of initiation of dosing. At doses of 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg twice daily the effectiveness of celecoxib was shown to be similar to that of naproxen 500 mg twice daily. Doses of 200 mg twice daily provided no additional benefit above that seen with 100 mg twice daily.

                        <paragraph>Celecoxib Long-Term Arthritis Safety Study (CLASS): This was a prospective, long-term, safety outcome study conducted post-marketing in approximately 5,800 OA patients and 2,200 RA patients. Patients received celecoxib 400 mg twice daily (4-fold and 2-fold the recommended OA and RA doses, respectively), ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (common therapeutic doses). Median exposures for celecoxib (n = 3,987) and diclofenac (n = 1,996) were 9 months while ibuprofen (n = 1,985) was 6 months. The primary endpoint of this outcome study was the incidence of complicated ulcers (gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or obstruction). Patients were allowed to take concomitant low-dose (≤ 325 mg/day) aspirin (ASA) for cardiovascular prophylaxis (ASA subgroups: celecoxib, n = 882; diclofenac, n = 445; ibuprofen, n = 412). Differences in the incidence of complicated ulcers between celecoxib and the combined group of ibuprofen and diclofenac were not statistically significant.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients on celecoxib and concomitant low-dose ASA (N=882) experienced 4-fold higher rates of complicated ulcers compared to those not on ASA (N=3105). The Kaplan-Meier rate for complicated ulcers at 9 months was 1.12% versus 0.32% for those on low-dose ASA and those not on ASA, respectively [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.4">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated cumulative rates at 9 months of complicated and symptomatic ulcers for patients treated with celecoxib 400 mg twice daily are described in Table 4. Table 4 also displays results for patients less than or greater than 65 years of age. The difference in rates between celecoxib alone and celecoxib with ASA groups may be due to the higher risk for GI events in ASA users.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a small number of patients with a history of ulcer disease, the complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates in patients taking celecoxib alone or celecoxib with ASA were, respectively, 2.56% (n=243) and 6.85% (n=91) at 48 weeks. These results are to be expected in patients with a prior history of ulcer disease [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.4">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cardiovascular safety outcomes were also evaluated in the CLASS trial. Kaplan-Meier cumulative rates for investigator-reported serious cardiovascular thromboembolic adverse events (including MI, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, unstable angina, transient ischemic attacks, and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents) demonstrated no differences between the celecoxib, diclofenac, or ibuprofen treatment groups. The cumulative rates in all patients at nine months for celecoxib, diclofenac, and ibuprofen were 1.2%, 1.4%, and 1.1%, respectively. The cumulative rates in non-ASA users at nine months in each of the three treatment groups were less than 1%. The cumulative rates for myocardial infarction in non-ASA users at nine months in each of the three treatment groups were less than 0.2%. There was no placebo group in the CLASS trial, which limits the ability to determine whether the three drugs tested had no increased risk of CV events or if they all increased the risk to a similar degree.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Endoscopic Studies: The correlation between findings of short-term endoscopic studies with celecoxib and the relative incidence of clinically significant serious upper GI events with long-term use has not been established. Serious clinically significant upper GI bleeding has been observed in patients receiving celecoxib in controlled and open-labeled trials [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S5.4">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.6">Clinical Studies (14.6)</linkHtml>]</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A randomized, double-blind study in 430 RA patients was conducted in which an endoscopic examination was performed at 6 months. The incidence of endoscopic ulcers in patients taking celecoxib 200 mg twice daily was 4% vs. 15% for patients taking diclofenac SR 75 mg twice daily. However, celecoxib was not statistically different than diclofenac for clinically relevant GI outcomes in the CLASS trial [see <linkHtml href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8aaf6b5f-efc6-4040-81d9-f781d135bbc0#S14.6">Clinical Studies (14.6)</linkHtml>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The incidence of endoscopic ulcers was studied in two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies in 2157 OA and RA patients in whom baseline endoscopies revealed no ulcers. There was no dose relationship for the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers and the dose of celecoxib (50 mg to 400 mg twice daily). The incidence for naproxen 500 mg twice daily was 16.2 and 17.6% in the two studies, for placebo was 2.0 and 2.3%, and for all doses of celecoxib the incidence ranged between 2.7%–5.9%. There have been no large, clinical outcome studies to compare clinically relevant GI outcomes with celecoxib and naproxen.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the endoscopic studies, approximately 11% of patients were taking aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day). In the celecoxib groups, the endoscopic ulcer rate appeared to be higher in aspirin users than in non-users. However, the increased rate of ulcers in these aspirin users was less than the endoscopic ulcer rates observed in the active comparator groups, with or without aspirin.</paragraph>
