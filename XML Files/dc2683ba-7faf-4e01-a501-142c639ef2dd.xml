                        <paragraph>SPRIX is not an inhaled product. Do not inhale when administering this product.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Instruct patients to administer as follows:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>1.	First hold the finger flange with fingers, and remove the clear plastic cover with opposite hand; then remove the blue plastic safety clip.  Keep the clear plastic cover; and throw away the blue plastic safety clip. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>2.	Before using the bottle for the <content styleCode="bold">FIRST</content> time, activate the pump. To activate the pump, hold the bottle at arm’s length away from the body with index finger and middle finger resting on the top of the finger flange and thumb supporting the base.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="bold">Press down evenly and release the pump 5 times.</content> Patient may not see a spray the first few times he/she presses down.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The bottle is now ready to use.  There is no need to activate the pump again if more doses are used from the bottle.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>3.	It’s important to get the medication to the correct place in the nose so it will be most effective.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>    - Blow nose gently to clear nostrils.<br/>    - Sit up straight or stand.  Tilt head slightly forward.<br/>    - Insert the tip of the container into your right nostril.  <br/>    - Point the container away from the center of your nose. <br/>    - Hold your breath and spray once into your right nostril, pressing down evenly on both sides.<br/>    - Immediately after administration, resume breathing through mouth to reduce expelling the product.  Also pinch the nose to help retain the spray if it starts to drip.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>    If only one spray per dose is prescribed, administration is complete; skip to Step 5 below.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>4.	If a dose of 2 sprays is prescribed, repeat the process in Step 3 for the left nostril. Again, be sure to point the spray away from the center of nose. Spray once into the left nostril.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>5.	Replace the clear plastic cover and place the bottle in a cool, dry location out of direct sunlight, such as inside a medication cabinet. Keep out of reach of children.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#s_0502">5.2</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.

                        <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid the use of SPRIX in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If SPRIX is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>SPRIX is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation [<content styleCode="italics">see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#s_0400">4</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including ketorolac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, SPRIX is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<content styleCode="italics">see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#s_0400">4</linkHtml>)</content>]. When SPRIX is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</paragraph>

These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of SPRIX at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

                        <paragraph>Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with SPRIX has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. Do not use SPRIX in patients for whom hemostasis is critical [<content styleCode="italics">see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#s_0400">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#s_0700">7</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including SPRIX, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<content styleCode="italics">see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#s_0700">7</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The concurrent use of ketorolac and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans, has not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only with extreme caution. Monitor patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis closely.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials, serious adverse events related to bleeding were more common in patients treated with SPRIX than placebo.  In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience with ketorolac IV and IM dosing, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with peri-operative use. Therefore, use SPRIX with caution in the postoperative setting when hemostasis is critical.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SPRIX in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies in rabbits and rats tested at 0.6 and 1.5 times the human systemic exposure, respectively, at the recommended maximum IN dose of 31.5 mg four times a day, there was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as ketorolac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</paragraph>

These studies did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse developmental outcomes.

After a single administration of 10 mg ketorolac, the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum milk to plasma ratio was 0.037. After 1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Assuming a daily intake of 400-1000 mL of human milk per day and a maternal body weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant exposure was 0.00263 mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight adjusted dose.</paragraph>

Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including SPRIX, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</paragraph>

If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [<content styleCode="italics">see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#s_0204">2.4</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#s_0501">5.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#s_0502">5.2</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#s_0503">5.3</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#s_0506">5.6, </linkHtml>

                  <paragraph>Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#s_0501">5.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#s_0502">5.2</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#s_0504">5.4</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#s_0506">5.6</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There has been no experience with overdosage of SPRIX. In controlled overdosage studies with IM ketorolac injection, daily doses of 360 mg given for five days (approximately 3 times the maximum daily dose of SPRIX) caused abdominal pain and peptic ulcers, which healed after discontinuation of dosing. Single overdoses of ketorolac tromethamine have been variously associated with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation, peptic ulcers and/or erosive gastritis, and renal dysfunction.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ketorolac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of SPRIX, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), an early component of the arachidonic acid cascade, resulting in the reduced synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ketorolac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Ketorolac concentrations reached during therapy have produced <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ketorolac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Scintigraphic assessment of drug disposition of ketorolac following SPRIX intranasal dosing demonstrated that most of the ketorolac was deposited in the nasal cavity and pharynx, with less than 20% deposited in the esophagus and stomach, and zero or negligible deposition in the lungs (&lt;0.5%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean apparent volume (Vβ) of ketorolac tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The ketorolac tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99.2%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations. Therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, warfarin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, phenytoin, and tolbutamide did not alter ketorolac protein binding. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of salicylate (300 mcg/mL), the binding of ketorolac was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> binding of warfarin to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by ketorolac (99.5% control vs. 99.3%) when ketorolac plasma concentrations reach 5 to 10 mcg/mL.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine. There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged ketorolac. Approximately 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg ketorolac tromethamine (n = 9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately two times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no inversion of the R- to S- form in humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD ± 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD ± 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In patients with renal disease, the AUC<sub>∞</sub> of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of ketorolac tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction. The AUC<sub>∞</sub>-ratio of the ketorolac tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Before you use SPRIX for the first time, you will need to prime the bottle.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Priming SPRIX:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 1. Hold the finger flange with your fingers <content styleCode="bold">(see <linkHtml href="#figa">Figure A</linkHtml>)</content>, and remove the clear plastic cover with your opposite hand. Keep the clear plastic cover for later. Remove and throw away the blue plastic safety clip.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph ID="figa">
                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM003"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If the clear plastic cover is improperly removed, the tip of the bottle may be pulled off of the glass vial.  If this happens, place the tip back onto the glass vial by lining it up carefully and gently pushing it back on until it is back in the correct position <content styleCode="bold">(see <linkHtml href="#figb">Figure B</linkHtml>)</content>. The SPRIX bottle should work properly again.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph ID="figb">
                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM004"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 2. Hold the SPRIX bottle upright at arm’s length away from you with your index finger and middle finger resting on the top of the finger flange and your thumb supporting the base <content styleCode="bold">(see <linkHtml href="#figc">Figure C</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Press down on the finger flange and release the pump 5 times.</content> You may not see a spray the first few times you press down.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Now the pump is primed and ready to use. You do not need to prime the pump again if you use more doses from this bottle.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph ID="figc">
                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM005"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 3. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 4. Sit up straight or stand.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 5. Keep your head tilted downward toward your toes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 6. Place the tip of the SPRIX bottle into your right nostril.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 7. Hold the SPRIX bottle upright and aim the tip toward the back of your nose <content styleCode="bold">(see <linkHtml href="#figd">Figure D</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph ID="figd">
                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM006"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 8. Hold your breath and spray 1 time into your right nostril, pressing down on both sides of the finger flange <content styleCode="bold">(see <linkHtml href="#figd">Figure D</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 9. Breathe in gently through your mouth after you use SPRIX. You may also pinch your nose to help keep the medicine in your nose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 10. If your healthcare provider has prescribed only 1 spray per dose for you, you have now finished your dose, skip to Step 12 below.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 11. If your healthcare provider has prescribed 2 sprays for you, repeat steps 3 - 9 above for your left nostril. Be sure to point the spray away from the center of your nose. Spray 1 time into your left nostril.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Step 12. When you are finished using SPRIX, put the clear plastic cover back on the SPRIX bottle.</paragraph>
