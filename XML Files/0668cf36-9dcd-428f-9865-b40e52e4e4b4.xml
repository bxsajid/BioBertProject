                  <linkHtml href=""/>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY<content styleCode="bold">Hydrocodone Component </content>
                  <br/>Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic 
opioid analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to 
those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth 
muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opioids is not 
known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in 
the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, opioids may produce 
drowsiness, changes in mood, and mental clouding. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="bold">Ibuprofen 
Component </content>
                  <br/>Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that 
possesses analgesic and antipyretic activities. Its mode action, like that of 
other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be related to inhibition of 
cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis. Ibuprofen is a peripherally 
acting analgesic. Ibuprofen does not have any known effects on opiate receptors. 
<br/>
                  <content styleCode="bold">Pharmacokinetics</content>
                  <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Absorption</content>: After oral dosing with the REPREXAIN™tablet, 
a peak hydrocodone plasma level of 27 ng/mL is achieved at 1.7 hours, and a peak 
ibuprofen plasma level of 30 mcg/mL is achieved at 1.8 hours. The effect of food 
on the absorption of either component from the REPREXAIN™ tablet has not been 
established.  <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Distribution</content>: Ibuprofen is highly 
protein-bound (99%) like most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. 
Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone in human plasma has not 
been definitely determined, structural similarities to related opioid analgesics 
suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein bound. As most agents in the 
5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to<br/>a 
similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% [oxycodone]), hydrocodone is 
expected to fall within this range. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism</content>: 
Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including O-demethylation, 
N-demethylation, and 6-keto reduction to the corresponding 6-a-and 6-ßhydroxy 
metabolites. Hydromorphone, a potent opioid, is formed from the O -demethylation 
of hydrocodone and contributes to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone. The 
O-and N -demethylation processes are mediated by separate P-450 isoenzymes: 
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, respectively. <br/>Ibuprofen is present in this product as a 
racemate, and following absorption it undergoes interconversion in the plasma 
from the R-isomer to the S-isomer. Both the R- and S-isomers are metabolized to 
two primary metabolites:<br/>(+)-2-4’-(2hydroxy-2-methyl-propyl) phenyl propionic 
acid and (+)-2-4’-(2carboxypropyl) phenyl propionic acid, both of 
which<br/>circulate in the plasma at low levels relative to the parent.  
<br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Elimination</content>: Hydrocodone and its metabolites 
are eliminated primarily in the kidneys, with a mean plasma half-life of 4.5 
hours. Ibuprofen is excreted in the urine, 50% to 60% as metabolites and 
approximately 15% as unchanged drug and conjugate. The plasma half-life is 2.2 
hours.  <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Special Populations</content>: No significant 
pharmacokinetic differences based on age or gender have been demonstrated. The 
pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone and ibuprofen from REPREXAIN™ has not been 
evaluated in children. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Renal Impairment</content>:The 
effect of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of the REPREXAIN™ dosage 
form has not been determined.<br/>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>CLINICAL STUDIES<paragraph>In single-dose studies of post surgical pain (abdominal, 
gynecological, orthopedic), 940 patients were studied at doses of one or two 
tablets. REPREXAIN™ produced greater efficacy than placebo and each of its

the two-tablet dose.</paragraph>

                     <br/>Cardiovascular 
Thrombotic Events <br/>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and 
nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk 
of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and 
stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, 
may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV 
disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV 
event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be 
used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain 
alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV 
symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious 
CV events and the steps to take if they occur. <br/>There is no consistent 
evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious 
CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin 
and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see <content styleCode="bold">GI WARNINGS</content>). <br/>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a 
COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days 
following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and 
stroke (see <content styleCode="bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</content>). <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Hypertension</content>
                     <br/>NSAID-containing products, including 
REPREXAIN™, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting 
hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV 
events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response 
to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAID-containing products, including 
REPREXAIN™, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood 
pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID 
treatment and throughout the course of therapy. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Congestive 
Heart Failure and Edema</content>
                     <br/>Fluid retention and edema have been observed 
in some patients taking NSAIDs. REPREXAIN™ should be used with caution in 
patients with fluid retention or heart failure. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Misuse 
Abuse and Diversion of Opioids</content>
                     <br/>REPREXAIN™ contains hydrocodone an 
opioid agonist, and is a Schedule III controlled substance. Opioid agonists have 
the potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with 
addiction disorders, and are subject to diversion. <br/>REPREXAIN™ can be abused 
in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be 
considered when prescribing or dispensing REPREXAIN™ in situations where the 
physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse or 
diversion (see <content styleCode="bold">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</content>). <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Respiratory Depression</content>
                     <br/>At high doses or in 
opioid-sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce dose-related respiratory 
depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory centers. Hydrocodone 
also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce 
irregular and periodic breathing. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Head Injury and Increased 
Intracranial Pressure</content>
                     <br/>The respiratory depressant effects of opioids 
and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly 
exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a 
pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce 
adverse reactions, which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head 
injuries. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Acute Abdominal Conditions</content>
                     <br/>The

patients with acute abdominal conditions.<br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Gastrointestinal 
(GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation</content>
                     <br/>NSAIDs, including REPREXAIN™, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) 
adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of 
the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These 
serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, 
in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develops a 
serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI 
ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 
1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for 
one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the 
likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of 
therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. <br/>NSAIDs should 
be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer 
disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic 
ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater 
than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with 
neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI 
bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral 
corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, 
use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous 
reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, 
special care should be taken in treating this population. <br/>To minimize the 
potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the 
lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. 
Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI 
ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional 
evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should 
include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled 
out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs 
should be considered. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Renal Effects </content>
                     <br/>Long-term 
administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other 
renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal 
prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. 
In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may 
cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in 
renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at 
greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart 
failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the 
elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Advanced Renal Disease</content>
                     <br/>No 
information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of 
REPREXAIN™ in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with 
REPREXAIN™ is not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease. If 
REPREXAIN™ therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient’s renal 
function is advisable. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Anaphylactoid Reactions</content>
                     <br/>As with other NSAID-containing products, anaphylactoid reactions may occur 
in patients without known prior exposure to REPREXAIN™. REPREXAIN™ should not be 
given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs 
in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or 
who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other 
NSAIDs. Fatal reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see <content styleCode="bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</content> and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content> - 
<content styleCode="bold">Pre-existing Asthma</content>). Emergency help should be sought in 
cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Skin 
Reactions</content>
                     <br/>Products containing NSAIDs, including REPREXAIN™, can cause 
serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These 
serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the 
signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be 
discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of 
hypersensitivity. <br/>

                     <br/>REPREXAIN™ cannot be expected 
to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. 
Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. 
Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered 
slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological 
activity of REPREXAIN™ in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the 
utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed 
noninfectious, painful conditions. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Special Risk 
Patients</content>
                     <br/>As with any opioid analgesic agent, REPREXAIN™ should be 
used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients, and those with severe 
impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison’s disease, 
prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture. The usual precautions should be 
observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind. 
<br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Cough Reflex </content>
                     <br/>Hydrocodone suppresses the cough 
reflex; as with opioids, caution should be exercised when REPREXAIN™ is used 
postoperatively and in patients with pulmonary disease. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Hepatic Effects </content>
                     <br/>Borderline elevations of one or more liver 
enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen as 
found in REPREXAIN™. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain 
essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Notable 
elevations of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) (approximately three or more times the 
upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in 
clinical trials with NSAIDS. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic 
reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and 
hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported. <br/>A 
patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an 
abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of more severe hepatic reactions while on REPREXAIN™ therapy. If 
clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if 
systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, etc.), REPREXAIN™ should 
be discontinued. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Hematological Effects </content>
                     <br/>Anemia is 
sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs including ibuprofen as found in 
REPREXAIN™. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, 
or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term 
treatment with NSAIDs including ibuprofen, should have their hemoglobin or 
hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. <br/>NSAIDs 
inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in 
some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
REPREXAIN™ who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, 
such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, 
should be carefully monitored. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Pre-existing Asthma</content>
                     <br/>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin 
in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe 
bronchospasm, which may be fatal. Since cross-reactivity between aspirin and 
other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, REPREXAIN™ 
should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and 
should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing asthma. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Aseptic Meningitis</content>
                     <br/>Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma 
has been observed on rare occasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy as found in 
REPREXAIN™. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been 
reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs or 
symptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on REPREXAIN™, the possibility of 
its being related to ibuprofen should be considered. <br/>

</content>
                     <br/>REPREXAIN™ contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist, and is a Schedule 
III controlled substance. REPREXAIN™, and other opioids used in analgesia can be 
abused and are subject to criminal diversion. <br/>Addiction is a primary, 
chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental 
factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by 
behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug 
use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is 
a treatable disease utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is 
common. <br/>“Drug seeking” behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers. 
Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office 
hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated 
“loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide 
prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician(s). 
“Doctor shopping” to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug 
abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. <br/>Abuse and addiction 
are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Physical 
dependence usually assumes clinically significant dimensions only after several 
weeks of continued opioid use, although a mild degree of physical dependence may 
develop after a few days of opioid therapy. Tolerance, in which increasingly 
large doses are required in order to produce the same degree of analgesia, is 
manifested initially by a shortened duration of analgesic effect, and 
subsequently by decreases in the intensity of analgesia. The rate of development 
of tolerance varies among patients. Physicians should be aware that abuse of 
opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by 
misuse for nonmedical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive 
substances. REPREXAIN™, like other opioids, may be diverted for non-medical use. 
Record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and 
renewal requests is strongly advised. <br/>Proper assessment of the patient, 
proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper 
dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of 
opioid drugs.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>OVERDOSAGE<paragraph>Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from 
hydrocodone and/or ibuprofen. <br/>Signs and Symptoms <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Hydrocodone Component</content>
                     <br/>Serious overdose with hydrocodone is 
characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or 
tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis) extreme somnolence 
progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, 
and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In severe overdosage, apnea, 
circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. <br/>Ibuprofen 
Component <br/>Symptoms include gastrointestinal irritation with erosion and 
hemorrhage or perforation, kidney damage, liver damage, heart damage, hemolytic 
anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and meningitis. 
Other symptoms may include headache, dizziness, tinnitus, confusion, blurred 
vision, mental disturbances, skin rash, stomatitis, edema, reduced retinal 
sensitivity, corneal deposits, and hyperkalemia. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Treatment 
</content>
                     <br/>Primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate 
respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and the institution of 
assisted or controlled ventilation. Naloxone, a narcotic antagonist, can reverse 
respiratory depression and coma associated with opioid overdose or unusual 
sensitivity to opioids, including hydrocodone. Therefore, an appropriate dose of 
naloxone hydrochloride should be administered intravenously with simultaneous 
efforts at respiratory resuscitation. Since the duration of action of 
hydrocodone may exceed that of the naloxone, the patient should be kept under 
continuous surveillance and repeated doses of the antagonist should be 
administered as needed to maintain adequate respiration. Supportive measures 
should be employed as indicated. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing 
unabsorbed drug. In cases where consciousness is impaired it may be inadvisable 
to perform gastric lavage. If gastric lavage is performed, little drug will 
likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Ibuprofen 
is acidic and is excreted in the urine; therefore, it may be beneficial to 
administer alkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures the 
use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and 
reabsorption of ibuprofen. Dialysis is not likely to be effective for removal of 
ibuprofen because it is very highly bound to plasma proteins.</paragraph>

(hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets) and other treatment options 
before deciding to use REPREXAIN™. Use the lowest effective dose for the 
shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>). <br/>After observing the response to initial therapy 
with REPREXAIN™, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual 
patient’s needs. <br/>For the short-term (generally less than 10 days) management 
of acute pain, the recommended dose of REPREXAIN™ is one tablet every 4 to 6 
hours, as necessary. Dosage should not exceed 5 tablets in a 24-hour period. It 
should be kept in mind that tolerance to hydrocodone can develop with continued 
use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. <br/>The lowest 
effective dose or the longest dosing interval should be sought for each patient 
(see<content styleCode="bold"> WARNINGS</content>), especially in the elderly. After 
observing the initial response to therapy with REPREXAIN™, the dose and 
frequency of dosing should be adjusted to suit the individual patient’s need, 
without exceeding the total daily dose recommended.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Information for Patients<paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Patients should be informed of the following 
information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the 
course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the 
REPREXAIN™ Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed. 
</content>
                     <br/>1. REPREXAIN™ (hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets), like 
other opioid-containing analgesics, may impair mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a 
car or operating machinery; patients should be cautioned accordingly. <br/>2. 
Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression, when 
taken with this combination product, and should be avoided. <br/>3. REPREXAIN™ 
(hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets) can be abused in a manner similar 
to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. REPREXAIN™ may be habit-forming. 
Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the 
amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed. <br/>4. REPREXAIN™, 
like other NSAID-containing products, may cause serious CV side effects, such as 
MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although 
serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert 
for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, 
slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any 
indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of 
this follow-up (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects</content>). 
<br/>5. REPREXAIN™, like other NSAID-containing products, can cause GI discomfort 
and serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in 
hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and 
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the 
signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical 
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, 
dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the 
importance of this follow-up (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal 
Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation</content>). <br/>6. 
REPREXAIN™, like other NSAID-containing products, can cause serious skin side 
effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in 
hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur 
without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin 
rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, 
and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or 
symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they 
develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible. 
<br/>7. Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight 
gain or edema to their physicians. <br/>8. Patients should be informed of the 
warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, 
pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). 
If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate 
medical therapy. <br/>9. Patients should be informed of the signs of an 
anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or 
throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate 
emergency help (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>). <br/>10. In late 
pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, REPREXAIN™ should be avoided because it may 
cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. <br/>11. Patients should be 
instructed to report any signs of blurred vision or other eye symptoms.

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and 
a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
REPREXAIN™ should be discontinued. <br/>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Drug Interactions<content styleCode="underline">ACE-inhibitors</content>: Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish 
the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given 
consideration in patients taking REPREXAIN™ concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors. 
<br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Anticholinergics</content>: The concurrent use of 
anticholinergics with hydrocodone preparations may produce paralytic ileus. 
<br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Antidepressants</content>: The use of Monoamine Oxidase 
Inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants with REPREXAIN™ may increase the 
effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone. <br/>MAOIs have been reported 
to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion 
and significant depression of respiration or coma. The use of hydrocodone is not 
recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such 
treatment. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Aspirin</content>: When REPREXAIN™ is 
administered with aspirin, the protein binding of aspirin is reduced, although 
the clearance of free REPREXAIN™ is not altered. The clinical significance of 
this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAID-containing products, 
concomitant administration of REPREXAIN™ and aspirin is not generally 
recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">CNS Depressants</content>: Patients receiving other opioids, 
antihistamines, antipsychotics, antianxiety agents, or other CNS depressants 
(including alcohol) concomitantly with REPREXAIN™ may exhibit an additive CNS 
depression. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both 
agents should be reduced. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Diuretics</content>: Ibuprofen 
has been shown to reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in 
some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal 
prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with REPREXAIN™  the patient 
should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS - Renal Effects</content>), as well as diuretic efficacy. 
<br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Lithium</content>: Ibuprofen has been shown to elevate 
plasma lithium concentration and reduce renal lithium clearance. The mean 
minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was 
decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of 
renal prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when REPREXAIN™ and lithium 
are administered concurrently, patients should be observed for signs of lithium 
toxicity. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Methotrexate</content>: Ibuprofen, as well as 
other NSAIDs, has been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that ibuprofen could 
enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when REPREXAIN™ is 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Mixed 
Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics</content>: Agonist/antagonist analgesics 
(i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol and buprenorphine) should be 
administered with caution to patients who have received or are receiving a 
course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as hydrocodone. In 
this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic 
effect of hydrocodone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these 
patients. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</content>: 
Hydrocodone, as well as other opioid analgesics, may enhance the neuromuscular 
blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of 
respiratory depression. <br/>
                  <content styleCode="underline">Warfarin</content>: The effects 
of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both 
drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either 
drug alone. <br/>

                  <paragraph>REPREXAIN™, administered to rabbits at 95 mg/kg (5.72 and 1.9 times the 
maximum clinical dose based on body weight and surface area, respectively), a 
maternally toxic dose, resulted in an increase in the percentage of litters and 
fetuses with any major abnormality and an increase in the number of litters and 
fetuses with one or more nonossified metacarpals (a minor abnormality). 
REPREXAIN™, administered to rats at 166 mg/kg (10.0 and 1.66 times the maximum 
clinical dose based on body weight and surface area, respectively), a maternally 
toxic dose, did not result in any reproductive toxicity. However, animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. REPREXAIN™ should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
to the fetus. <br/>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Nonteratogenic Effects</content>: Because 
of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal 
cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy 
(particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Babies born to mothers who have 
been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. 
The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, 
hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, 
yawning, vomiting, and fever. The intensity of the syndrome does not always 
correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. There is no 
consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal. <br/>

                     <br/>Labor and Delivery <br/>As with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia and delayed 
parturition occurred in rats. Administration of REPREXAIN™ is not recommended 
during labor and delivery. The effects of REPREXAIN™ on labor and delivery in 
pregnant women are unknown. <br/>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. In 
limited studies, an assay capable of detecting 1 mcg/mL did not demonstrate 
ibuprofen in the milk of lactating mothers. However, because of the limited 
nature of the studies, and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in nursing infants from REPREXAIN™, a decision should be made whether 
to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the 
importance of the drug to the mother. <br/>

below the age of 16 have not been established.<br/>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Use<paragraph>In controlled clinical trials there was no difference in 
tolerability between patients less than 65 years of age and those more than or 
equal to 65, apart from an increased tendency of the elderly to develop 
constipation. However, because the elderly may be more sensitive to the renal 
and gastrointestinal effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents as well as 
possible increased risk of respiratory depression with opioids, extra caution 
and reduced dosages should be used when treating the elderly with REPREXAIN™  
(hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets).</paragraph>
