                        <paragraph>Naproxen is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%.  The different dosage forms of naproxen are bioequivalent in terms of extent of absorption (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax); however, the products do differ in their pattern of absorption. These differences between naproxen products are related to both the chemical form of naproxen used and its formulation. Even with the observed differences in pattern of absorption, the elimination half-life of naproxen is unchanged across products ranging from 12 to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days, and the degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this half-life.  This suggests that the differences in pattern of release play only a negligible role in the attainment of steady-state plasma levels.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Naproxen delayed-release tablets are designed with a pH-sensitive coating to provide a barrier to disintegration in the acidic environment of the stomach and to lose integrity in the more neutral environment of the small intestine. The enteric polymer coating selected for Naproxen delayed-release tablets dissolves above pH 6.  When Naproxen delayed-release tablets was given to fasted subjects, peak plasma levels were attained about 4 to 6 hours following the first dose (range: 2 to 12 hours). An in vivo study in man using radiolabeled Naproxen delayed-release tablets demonstrated that Naproxen delayed-release tablets dissolves primarily in the small intestine rather than in the stomach, so the absorption of the drug is delayed until the stomach is emptied.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In pediatric patients aged 5 to 16 years with arthritis, plasma naproxen levels following a 5 mg/kg single dose of naproxen suspension (see <linkHtml href="#b51cfeec-b68c-4b27-bfa2-a6207fb5db8c">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>) were found to be similar to those found in normal adults following a 500 mg dose. The terminal half-life appears to be similar in pediatric and adult patients.  Pharmacokinetic studies of naproxen were not performed in pediatric patients younger than 5 years of age.  Pharmacokinetic parameters appear to be similar following administration of Naproxen delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients. Naproxen delayed-release tablets have not been studied in subjects under the age of 18.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Naproxen has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis and bursitis, and acute gout.  Improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time.  Generally, response to naproxen has not been found to be dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a clinical trial comparing standard formulations of naproxen 375 mg bid (750 mg a day) vs 750 mg bid (1500 mg/day), 9 patients in the 750 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events.  Nineteen patients in the 1500 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events.  Most of these adverse events were gastrointestinal events.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and juvenile arthritis, naproxen has been shown to be comparable to aspirin and indomethacin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but the frequency and severity of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, dyspepsia, heartburn) and nervous system adverse effects (tinnitus, dizziness, lightheadedness) were less in naproxen-treated patients than in those treated with aspirin or indomethacin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with ankylosing spondylitis, naproxen has been shown to decrease night pain, morning stiffness and pain at rest. In double-blind studies the drug was shown to be as effective as aspirin, but with fewer side effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with acute gout, a favorable response to naproxen was shown by significant clearing of inflammatory changes (eg, decrease in swelling, heat) within 24 to 48 hours, as well as by relief of pain and tenderness.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Naproxen has been studied in patients with mild to moderate pain secondary to postoperative, orthopedic, postpartum episiotomy and uterine contraction pain and dysmenorrhea.  Onset of pain relief can begin within 1 hour in patients taking naproxen and within 30 minutes in patients taking naproxen sodium.  Analgesic effect was shown by such measures as reduction of pain intensity scores, increase in pain relief scores, decrease in numbers of patients requiring additional analgesic medication, and delay in time to remedication. The analgesic effect has been found to last for up to 12 hours.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Naproxen may be used safely in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids; however, in controlled clinical trials, when added to the regimen of patients receiving corticosteroids, it did not appear to cause greater improvement over that seen with corticosteroids alone. Whether naproxen has a “steroid-sparing” effect has not been adequately studied. When added to the regimen of patients receiving gold salts, naproxen did result in greater improvement.  Its use in combination with salicylates is not recommended because there is evidence that aspirin increases the rate of excretion of naproxen and data are inadequate to demonstrate that naproxen and aspirin produce greater improvement over that achieved with aspirin alone.  In addition, as with other NSAIDs, the combination may result in higher frequency of adverse events than demonstrated for either product alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 51Cr blood loss and gastroscopy studies with normal volunteers, daily administration of 1000 mg of naproxen has been demonstrated to cause statistically significantly less gastric bleeding and erosion than 3250 mg of aspirin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Three 6-week, double-blind, multicenter studies with Naproxen delayed-release tablets (375 or 500 mg bid, n=385) and Naproxen immediate-release tablets (375 or 500 mg bid, n=279) were conducted comparing Naproxen delayed-release tablets with Naproxen immediate-release tablets, including 355 rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients who had a recent history of NSAID-related GI symptoms.  These studies indicated that Naproxen delayed-release tablets and Naproxen immediate-release tablets showed no significant differences in efficacy or safety and had similar prevalence of minor GI complaints.  Individual patients, however, may find one formulation preferable to the other.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Five hundred and fifty-three patients received Naproxen delayed-release tablets during long­ term open-label trials (mean length of treatment was 159 days). The rates for clinically-diagnosed peptic ulcers and GI bleeds were similar to what has been historically reported for long-term NSAID use.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The hepatic and renal tolerability of long-term naproxen administration was studied in two double-blind clinical trials involving 586 patients.  Of the patients studied, 98 patients were age 65 and older and 10 of the 98 patients were age 75 and older. Naproxen was administered at doses of 375 mg twice daily or 750 mg twice daily for up to 6 months.  Transient abnormalities of laboratory tests assessing hepatic and renal function were noted in some patients, although there were no differences noted in the occurrence of abnormal values among different age groups.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>

Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs.  NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with hypertension.

                              <paragraph>NSAIDs, including naproxen delayed-release tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year.  These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. The utility of periodic laboratory monitoring has not been demonstrated, nor has it been adequately assessed.  Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors.  Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.  For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Epidemiological studies, both of the case-control and cohort design, have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In two studies, concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin potentiated the risk of bleeding (see <linkHtml href="#b105a6d6-99cc-4ace-9dd4-afa09fa0e2a9">PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions</linkHtml>). Although these studies focused on upper gastrointestinal bleeding, there is reason to believe that bleeding at other sites may be similarly potentiated.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.  Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, salt depletion, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly.  Discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state (see <linkHtml href="#becd9cba-61ca-4c13-a247-3cbe90b4b6b7">WARNINGS: Advanced Renal Disease</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including naproxen delayed-release tablets. Hepatic abnormalities may be the result of hypersensitivity rather than direct toxicity. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. The SGPT (ALT) test is probably the most sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction.  Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs.  In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</paragraph>

Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in these patients.  It is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, naproxen should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that naproxen delayed-release tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient   should   be   observed   closely   for   signs   of   renal   failure   (see <linkHtml href="#b65e0323-85e7-4ae2-98ea-80d142bae606">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</linkHtml>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. Naproxen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model.  This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. No significant interactions have been observed in clinical studies with naproxen and coumarin-type anticoagulants.  However, caution is advised since interactions have been seen with other nonsteroidal agents of this class. The free fraction of warfarin may increase substantially in some subjects and naproxen interferes with platelet function.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>There is some evidence to suggest that when inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis are used to delay preterm labor there is an increased risk of neonatal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus and intracranial hemorrhage. Naproxen treatment given in late pregnancy to delay parturition has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction and abnormal prostaglandin E levels in preterm infants. Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. Naproxen-containing products are not recommended in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, naproxen may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage.  The effects of naproxen delayed-release tablets on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.</paragraph>

Pediatric dosing recommendations for juvenile arthritis are based on well-controlled studies (see <linkHtml href="#b51cfeec-b68c-4b27-bfa2-a6207fb5db8c">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>). There are no adequate effectiveness or dose-response data for other pediatric conditions, but the experience in juvenile arthritis and other use experience have established that single doses of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg (as naproxen suspension, see <linkHtml href="#b51cfeec-b68c-4b27-bfa2-a6207fb5db8c">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>), with total daily dose not exceeding 15 mg/kg/day, are well tolerated in pediatric patients over 2 years of age.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in the geriatric population (see <linkHtml href="#b5d87144-ae6c-4808-b73a-ae796252f8b9">WARNINGS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.  Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.  Geriatric patients may be at a greater risk for the development of a form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin formation during administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see <linkHtml href="#b65e0323-85e7-4ae2-98ea-80d142bae606">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in 960 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are listed below. In general, reactions in patients treated chronically were reported 2 to 10 times more frequently than they were in short-term studies in the 962 patients treated for mild to moderate pain or for dysmenorrhea.  The most frequent complaints reported related to the gastrointestinal tract.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A clinical study found gastrointestinal reactions to be more frequent and more severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking daily doses of 1500 mg naproxen compared to those taking 750 mg naproxen (see <linkHtml href="#b7dcd6d2-db37-4f6f-8623-83cac8253214">CLINICALPHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials with about 80 pediatric patients and in well­monitored, open-label studies with about 400 pediatric patients with juvenile arthritis treated with naproxen, the incidence of rash and prolonged bleeding times were increased, the incidence of gastrointestinal and central nervous system reactions were about the same, and the incidence of other reactions were lower in pediatric patients than in adults.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Significant naproxen overdosage may be characterized by lethargy, dizziness, drowsiness, epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, transient alterations in liver function, hypoprothrombinemia, renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, apnea, disorientation or vomiting.  Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur.  Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma may occur, but are rare.  Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.  Because naproxen sodium may be rapidly absorbed, high and early blood levels should be anticipated.  A few patients have experienced convulsions, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening. The oral LD50 of the drug is 543 mg/kg in rats, 1234 mg/kg in mice, 4110 mg/kg in hamsters, and greater than 1000 mg/kg in dogs.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although all naproxen-containing products circulate in the plasma as naproxen, they have pharmacokinetic differences that may affect onset of action. Because naproxen delayed-release tablets dissolves in the small intestine rather than in the stomach, the absorption of the drug is delayed compared to the other naproxen formulations (see <linkHtml href="#b7dcd6d2-db37-4f6f-8623-83cac8253214">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The recommended strategy for initiating therapy is to choose a formulation and a starting dose likely to be effective for the patient and then adjust the dosage based on observation of benefit and/or adverse events. A lower dose should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or in elderly patients (see <linkHtml href="#b5d87144-ae6c-4808-b73a-ae796252f8b9">WARNINGS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#b1cb9410-13f1-452c-b459-619d02f10c47">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly.  Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients.  As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient.  A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration.  The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and the administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily is not necessary.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required.  When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk.  The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response (see <linkHtml href="#b7dcd6d2-db37-4f6f-8623-83cac8253214">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
