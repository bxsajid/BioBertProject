                  <paragraph>Sulindac is available in 150 and 200 mg tablets for oral administration.  Each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, plasdone and sodium starch glycolate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following absorption, sulindac undergoes two major biotransformations - reversible reduction to the sulfide metabolite, and irreversible oxidation to the sulfone metabolite.  Available evidence indicates that the biological activity resides with the sulfide metabolite.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Sulindac, and its sulfone and sulfide metabolites, are 93.1, 95.4, and 97.9% bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to albumin.  Plasma protein binding measured over a concentration range (0.5-2.0 µg/mL) was constant.  Following an oral, radiolabeled dose of sulindac in rats, concentrations of radiolabel in red blood cells were about 10% of those in plasma.  Sulindac penetrates the blood-brain and placental barriers.  Concentrations in brain did not exceed 4% of those in plasma.  Plasma concentrations in the placenta and in the fetus were less than 25% and 5% respectively, of systemic plasma concentrations.  Sulindac is excreted in rat milk; concentrations in milk were 10 to 20% of those levels in plasma.  It is not known if sulindac is excreted in human milk.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Sulindac undergoes two major biotransformations of its sulfoxide moiety: oxidation to the inactive sulfone and reduction to the pharmacologically active sulfide.  The latter is readily reversible in animals and in man.  These metabolites are present as unchanged compounds in plasma and principally as glucuronide conjugates in human urine and bile.  A dihydroxydihydro analog has also been identified as a minor metabolite in human urine.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>With the twice-a-day dosage regimen, plasma concentrations of sulindac and its two metabolites accumulate: mean concentration over a dosage interval at steady state relative to the first dose averages 1.5 and 2.5 times higher, respectively, for sulindac and its active sulfide metabolite.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Sulindac and its sulfone metabolite undergo extensive enterohepatic circulation relative to the sulfide metabolite in animals. Studies in man have also demonstrated that recirculation of the parent drug sulindac and its sulfone metabolite is more extensive than that of the active sulfide metabolite.  The active sulfide metabolite accounts for less than six percent of the total intestinal exposure to sulindac and its metabolites.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Biochemical as well as pharmacological evidence indicates that the activity of sulindac resides in its sulfide metabolite. An in-vitro assay for inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity exhibited an EC
           
 
  
           
 
  <sub>50</sub> of 0.02µM for sulindac sulfide.  In-vivo models of inflammation indicate that activity is more highly correlated with concentrations of the metabolite than with parent drug concentrations.

                              <paragraph>Approximately 50% of the administered dose of sulindac is excreted in the urine with the conjugated sulfone metabolite accounting for the major portion.  Less than 1% of the administered dose of sulindac appears in the urine as the sulfide metabolite.

                              <paragraph>Because sulindac is excreted in the urine primarily as biologically inactive forms, it may possibly affect renal function to a lesser extent than other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; however, renal adverse experiences have been reported with sulindac (see

However, in other studies in healthy volunteers and patients with liver disease, sulindac was found to blunt the renal responses to intravenous furosemide, i.e., the diuresis, natriuresis, increments in plasma renin activity and urinary excretion of prostaglandins.  These observations may represent a differentiation of the effects of sulindac on renal functions based on differences in pathogenesis of the renal prostaglandin dependence associated with differing dose-response relationships of different NSAIDs to the various renal functions influenced by prostaglandins (see

                              <paragraph>Sulindac pharmacokinetics have been investigated in patients with renal insufficiency.  The disposition of sulindac was studied in end-stage renal disease patients requiring hemodialysis.  Plasma concentrations of sulindac and its sulfone metabolite were comparable to those of normal healthy volunteers whereas concentrations of the active sulfide metabolite were significantly reduced.  Plasma protein binding was reduced and the AUC of the unbound sulfide metabolite was about half that in healthy subjects.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Sulindac and its metabolites are not significantly removed from the blood in patients undergoing hemodialysis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Since sulindac is eliminated primarily by the kidneys, patients with significantly impaired renal function should be closely monitored.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>A lower daily dosage should be anticipated to avoid excessive drug accumulation.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In controlled clinical studies sulindac was evaluated in the following five conditions:</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of sulindac was demonstrated by clinical measurements that included: assessments by both patient and investigator of overall response; decrease in disease activity as assessed by both patient and investigator; improvement in ARA Functional Class; relief of night pain; improvement in overall evaluation of pain, including pain on weight bearing and pain on active and passive motion; improvement in joint mobility, range of motion, and functional activities; decreased swelling and tenderness; and decreased duration of stiffness following prolonged inactivity.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In clinical studies in which dosages were adjusted according to patient needs, sulindac, 200 to 400 mg daily was shown to be comparable in effectiveness to aspirin 2400 to 4800 mg daily.  Sulindac was generally well tolerated, and patients on it had a lower overall incidence of total adverse effects, of milder gastrointestinal reactions, and of tinnitus than did patients on aspirin.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal.  Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as sulindac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see

                              <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Avoid the use of sulindac tablets, in patients with recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If sulindac tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including sulindac, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs.  NSAIDs, including sulindac, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension.  Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including sulindac, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.  These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.  Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Upper GI ulcers,  gross bleeding, or  perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year.  These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy.  However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patients with a 
         
 
  
         
 
  <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding </content>who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors.  Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status.  Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.
        

 
        

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.  Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected.  This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.  For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

As with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, borderline elevations of one or more liver tests without any other signs and symptoms may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including sulindac.  These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy.  The SGPT (ALT) test is probably the most sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction.  Meaningful (3 times the upper limit of normal) elevations of SGPT or SGOT (AST) occurred in controlled clinical trials in less than 1% of patients. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs.  In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.

                        <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with sulindac.  Although such reactions as described above are rare, if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), sulindac should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.  Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion.In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.  Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, patients who are volume-depleted, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

Determinations of liver function should be considered whenever a patient on therapy with sulindac develops unexplained fever, rash or other dermatologic reactions or constitutional symptoms.  If unexplained fever or other evidence of hypersensitivity occurs, therapy with sulindac should be discontinued.  The elevated temperature and abnormalities in liver function caused by sulindac characteristically have reverted to normal after discontinuation of therapy.  Administration of sulindac should not be reinstituted in such patients.

This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis.  Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including sulindac, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>

Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.  Patients receiving sulindac who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>

Should pancreatitis be suspected, the drug should be discontinued and not restarted, supportive medical therapy instituted, and the patient monitored closely with appropriate laboratory studies (e.g., serum and urine amylase, amylase/creatinine clearance ratio, electrolytes, serum calcium, glucose, lipase, etc.).  A search for other causes of pancreatitis as well as those conditions which mimic pancreatitis should be conducted.

                              <paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists.  These interactions should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists.  In some patients with compromised renal function (e.g., elderly patients or patients who are volume-depleted, including those on diuretic therapy) who are being treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the co-administration of an NSAID and an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin II antagonist may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.  Therefore, monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving ACEIs or AIIAs and NSAIDs in combination therapy.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The concomitant administration of aspirin with sulindac significantly depressed the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite.  A double-blind study compared the safety and efficacy of sulindac 300 or 400 mg daily given alone or with aspirin 2.4 g/day for the treatment of osteoarthritis.  The addition of aspirin did not alter the types of clinical or laboratory adverse experiences for sulindac; however, the combination showed an increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse experiences.  Since the addition of aspirin did not have a favorable effect on the therapeutic response to sulindac, the combination is not recommended.</paragraph>

However, patients should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.  Special attention should be paid to patients taking higher doses than those recommended and to patients with renal impairment or other metabolic defects that might increase sulindac blood levels.  The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Although sulindac and its sulfide metabolite are highly bound to protein, studies in which sulindac was given at a dose of 400 mg daily, have shown no clinically significant interaction with oral hypoglycemic agents.  However, patients should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no change in their hypoglycemic dosage is required.  Special attention should be paid to patients taking higher doses than those recommended and to patients with renal impairment or other metabolic defects that might increase sulindac blood levels.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The known effect of drugs of this class on the human fetus during the third trimester of pregnancy include: constriction of the ductus arteriosus prenatally, tricuspid incompetence, and pulmonary hypertension; non-closure of the ductus arteriosus postnatally which may be resistant to medical management; myocardial degenerative changes, platelet dysfunction with resultant bleeding, intracranial bleeding, renal dysfunction or failure, renal injury/dysgenesis which may result in prolonged or permanent renal failure, oligohydramnios, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In reproduction studies in the rat, a decrease in average fetal weight and an increase in numbers of dead pups were observed on the first day of the postpartum period at dosage levels of 20 and 40 mg/kg/day (2½ and 5 times the usual maximum daily dose in humans), although there was no adverse effect on the survival and growth during the remainder of the postpartum period.  Sulindac prolongs the duration of gestation in rats, as do other compounds of this class.  Visceral and skeletal malformations observed in low incidence among rabbits in some teratology studies did not occur at the same dosage levels in repeat studies, nor at a higher dosage level in the same species.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In the event of overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage, and the patient carefully observed and given symptomatic and supportive treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Animal studies show that absorption is decreased by the prompt administration of activated charcoal and excretion is enhanced by alkalinization of the urine.</paragraph>

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with Sulindac Tablets USP, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Sulindac Tablets should be administered orally twice a day with food.  The maximum dosage is 400 mg per day.  Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended starting dosage is 150 mg twice a day.  The dosage may be lowered or raised depending on the response.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A prompt response (within one week) can be expected in about one-half of patients with osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.  Others may require longer to respond.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis, the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day.  After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced according to the response.  In acute painful shoulder, therapy for 7-14 days is usually adequate.  In acute gouty arthritis, therapy for 7 days is usually adequate.</paragraph>
