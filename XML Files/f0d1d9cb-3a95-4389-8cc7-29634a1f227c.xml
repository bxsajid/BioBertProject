                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Pharmacodynamics<paragraph>Flurbiprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that 
exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in animal 
models. The mechanism of action of flurbiprofen, like that of other 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is not completely understood but may be 
related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Pharmacokinetics<linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Absorption<paragraph>The mean oral bioavailability of flurbiprofen 100 mg tablets is 
96% relative to an oral solution. Flurbiprofen is rapidly and 
non-stereoselectively absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 
about 2 hours (see <linkHtml href="#section-"> Table 1</linkHtml>). Administration of flurbiprofen 
with either food or antacids may alter the rate but not the extent of 
flurbiprofen absorption. Ranitidine has been shown to have no effect on either 
the rate or extent of flurbiprofen absorption.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Distribution<paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of both R- and 
S-flurbiprofen is approximately 0.12 L/Kg. Both flurbiprofen enantiomers are 
more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Plasma protein 
binding is relatively constant for the typical average steady-state 
concentrations (â¤ 10 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses. Flurbiprofen is 
poorly excreted into human milk. The nursing infant dose is predicted to be 
approximately 0.1 mg/day in the established milk of a woman taking flurbiprofen 
200 mg/day (see <linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Metabolism<paragraph>Several flurbiprofen metabolites have been identified in human 
plasma and urine. These metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3', 
4'-dihydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-flurbiprofen, their conjugates, 
and conjugated flurbiprofen. Unlike other arylpropionic acid derivatives (e.g., 
ibuprofen), metabolism of R-flurbiprofen to S-flurbiprofen is minimal. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 2C9 
plays an important role in the metabolism of flurbiprofen to its major 
metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen. The 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen metabolite 
showed little anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of inflammation. 
Flurbiprofen does not induce enzymes that alter its metabolism.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The total plasma clearance of unbound flurbiprofen is not stereoselective, 
and clearance of flurbiprofen is independent of dose when used within the 
therapeutic range.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Excretion<paragraph>Following dosing with flurbiprofen, less than 3% of flurbiprofen 
is excreted unchanged in the urine, with about 70% of the dose eliminated in the 
urine as parent drug and metabolites. Because renal elimination is a significant 
pathway of elimination of flurbiprofen metabolites, dosing adjustment in 
patients with moderate or severe renal dysfunction may be necessary to avoid 
accumulation of flurbiprofen metabolites. The mean terminal disposition 
half-lives (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of R- and S-flurbiprofen are similar, 
about 4.7 and 5.7 hours, respectively. There is little accumulation of 
flurbiprofen following multiple doses of flurbiprofen.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Geriatric<paragraph>Flurbiprofen pharmacokinetics were similar in geriatric arthritis 
patients, younger arthritis patients, and young healthy volunteers receiving 
flurbiprofen tablets 100 mg as either single or multiple doses.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Hepatic Insufficiency<paragraph>Hepatic metabolism may account for &gt; 90% of flurbiprofen 
elimination, so patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of 
flurbiprofen tablets compared to patients with normal hepatic function. The 
pharmacokinetics of R- and S-flurbiprofen were similar, however, in alcoholic 
cirrhosis patients (N = 8) and young healthy volunteers (N = 8) following 
administration of a single 200 mg dose of flurbiprofen tablets.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Flurbiprofen plasma protein binding may be decreased in patients with liver 
disease and serum albumin concentrations below 3.1 g/dL (see <linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS: General: Hepatic Effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Renal Insufficiency<paragraph>Renal clearance is an important route of elimination for 
flurbiprofen metabolites, but a minor route of elimination for unchanged 
flurbiprofen (â¤ 3% of total clearance). The unbound clearances of R- and 
S-flurbiprofen did not differ significantly between normal healthy volunteers (N 
= 6, 50 mg single dose) and patients with renal impairment (N = 8, inulin 
clearances ranging from 11 to 43 mL/min, 50 mg multiple doses). Flurbiprofen 
plasma protein binding may be decreased in patients with renal impairment and 
serum albumin concentrations below 3.9 g/dL. Elimination of flurbiprofen 
metabolites may be reduced in patients with renal impairment (see <linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS: General: Renal Effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Flurbiprofen is not significantly removed from the blood into dialysate in 
patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Antacids<paragraph>Administration of flurbiprofen to volunteers under fasting 
conditions or with antacid suspension yielded similar serum flurbiprofen-time 
profiles in young adult subjects (n = 12). In geriatric subjects (n = 7), there 
was a reduction in the rate but not the extent of flurbiprofen absorption.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Aspirin<paragraph>Concurrent administration of flurbiprofen and aspirin resulted in 
50% lower serum flurbiprofen concentrations. This effect of aspirin (which is 
also seen with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) has been 
demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 15) and in healthy 
volunteers (n = 16) (see <linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS: Drug

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents<paragraph>The effect of flurbiprofen on blood pressure response to 
propranolol and atenolol was evaluated in men with mild uncomplicated 
hypertension (n = 10). Flurbiprofen pretreatment attenuated the hypotensive 
effect of a single dose of propranolol but not atenolol. Flurbiprofen did not 
appear to affect the beta-blocker-mediated reduction in heart rate. Flurbiprofen 
did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug (see <linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Cimetidine, Ranitidine<paragraph>In normal volunteers (n = 9), pretreatment with cimetidine or 
ranitidine did not affect flurbiprofen pharmacokinetics, except for a small 
(13%) but statistically significant increase in the area under the serum 
concentration curve of flurbiprofen in subjects who received cimetidine.</paragraph>

either drug.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Diuretics<paragraph>Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that, like other 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, flurbiprofen can interfere with the 
effects of furosemide. Although results have varied from study to study, effects 
have been shown on furosemide-stimulated diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis. 
Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis 
have been shown to interfere with thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretics (see 
<linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Lithium<paragraph>In a study of 11 women with bipolar disorder receiving lithium 
carbonate at a dosage of 600 mg to 1200 mg/day, administration of 100 mg 
flurbiprofen every 12 hours increased plasma lithium concentrations by 19%. Four 
of 11 patients experienced a clinically important increase (&gt; 25% or &gt; 0.2 
mmol/L). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have also been reported to 
decrease the renal clearance of lithium by about 20% (see <linkHtml href="#section-"> PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Methotrexate<paragraph>In a study of six adult arthritis patients, coadministration of 
methotrexate (10 to 25 mg/dose) and flurbiprofen (300 mg/day) resulted in no

diabetics who were already receiving glyburide (n = 4), metformin (n = 2), 
chlorpropamide with phenformin (n = 3), or glyburide with phenformin (n = 6). 
Although there was a slight reduction in blood sugar concentrations during 
concomitant administration of flurbiprofen and hypoglycemic agents, there were 
no signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <linkHtml href="#section-8.2">WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <linkHtml href="#section-7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, can lead to onset of new 
hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may 
contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or 
loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. 
NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, should be used with caution in patients with 
hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the 
initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Congestive Heart Failure and Edema<paragraph>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients 
taking NSAIDs. Flurbiprofen should be used with caution in patients with fluid 
retention or heart failure.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, can cause serious 
gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, 
ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, 
which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or 
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five 
patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is 
symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs 
occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 
to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer 
duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at 
some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not 
without risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk 
factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated 
with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, 
longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor 
general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in 
elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in 
treating this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. 
This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse 
event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not 
involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. 
Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>In clinical studies, the elimination half-life of flurbiprofen 
was unchanged in patients with renal impairment. Flurbiprofen metabolites are 
eliminated primarily by the kidneys. Elimination of 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen was 
reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Therefore, 
treatment with flurbiprofen is not recommended in these patients with advanced 
renal disease. If flurbiprofen therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of 
the patients renal function is advisable (see <linkHtml href="#section-5">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients without known prior exposure to flurbiprofen. Flurbiprofen should not 
be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically 
occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal 
polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking 
aspirin or other NSAIDs (see <linkHtml href="#section-7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#section-9.1.3">PRECAUTIONS: General: Preexisting Asthma</linkHtml>). Emergency 
help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, flurbiprofen should be 
avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>PRECAUTIONS<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Flurbiprofen cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids 
or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of 
corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is 
made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of flurbiprofen in reducing fever and 
inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting 
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including 
flurbiprofen. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, 
or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST 
(approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported 
in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, 
including jaundice, fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, 
some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or with 
abnormal liver test values, should be evaluated for evidence of the development 
of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with flurbiprofen. If 
clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if 
systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), flurbiprofen 
should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, including flurbiprofen. This may be due to fluid 
retention, GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon 
erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, including flurbiprofen, should have their hemoglobin or 
hematocrit checked periodically even if they do not exhibit any signs or 
symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit platelet aggregation and have 
been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their 
effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and 
reversible. Flurbiprofen does not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin 
time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Patients receiving flurbiprofen 
who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those 
with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be 
carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, flurbiprofen should not be 
administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be 
used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Vision Changes<paragraph>Blurred and/or diminished vision has been reported with the use 
of flurbiprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients 
experiencing eye complaints should have ophthalmologic examinations</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs should have their CBC and chemistry profile checked periodically. If 
clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, 
systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or abnormal liver 
tests persist or worsen, flurbiprofen should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Drug Interactions<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>ACE Inhibitors<paragraph>Reports suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may 
diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. These interactions 
should be given consideration in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anticoagulants<paragraph>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are 
synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI 
bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. The physician should be 
cautious when administering flurbiprofen to patients taking warfarin or other 
anticoagulants.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Aspirin<paragraph>Concurrent administration of aspirin lowers serum flurbiprofen 
concentrations (see <linkHtml href="#section-5.4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug 
Interactions</linkHtml>). The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; 
however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of flurbiprofen and 
aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased 
adverse effects.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents<paragraph>Flurbiprofen attenuated the hypotensive effect of propranolol but 
not atenolol (see <linkHtml href="#section-5.4">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug 
Interactions</linkHtml>). The mechanism underlying this interference is unknown. 
Patients taking both flurbiprofen and a beta-blocker should be monitored to 
ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diuretics<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have 
shown that flurbiprofen can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and 
thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of 
renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the 
patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see <linkHtml href="#section-8.3">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</linkHtml>), as well as diuretic 
efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Lithium<paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin 
synthesis by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Thus, when non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects 
should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Methotrexate<paragraph>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported to 
competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This 
may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution 
should be used when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are administered 
concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy Category C<paragraph>Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not 
demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. <content styleCode="underline">Flurbiprofen should be used in pregnancy only if the potential 
benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus</content>.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nonteratogenic Effects<paragraph>Because of the known effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use 
during late pregnancy should be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Labor and Delivery<paragraph>In rat studies with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as 
with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased 
incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. 
The effects of flurbiprofen on labor and delivery in pregnant women are 
unknown.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>Concentrations of flurbiprofen in breast milk and plasma of 
nursing mothers suggest that a nursing infant could receive approximately 0.10 
mg flurbiprofen per day in the established milk of a woman taking flurbiprofen 
200 mg/day. Because of possible adverse effects of prostaglandin-inhibiting 
drugs on neonates, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or 
to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the 
mother.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pediatric Use<paragraph>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been 
established.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Use<paragraph>As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the 
elderly (65 years and older). Clinical experience with flurbiprofen suggests 
that elderly patients may have a higher incidence of gastrointestinal complaints 
than younger patients, including ulceration, bleeding, flatulence, bloating, and 
abdominal pain. To minimize the potential risk for gastrointestinal events, the 
lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration (see <linkHtml href="#section-8.2">WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects</linkHtml>). Likewise, elderly 
patients are at greater risk of developing renal decompensation (see <linkHtml href="#section-8.3">WARNINGS: Renal Effects</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen do not seem to differ in elderly 
patients from those in younger individuals (see <linkHtml href="#section-5.3">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations</linkHtml>). The rate of absorption of flurbiprofen 
was reduced in elderly patients who also received antacids, although the extent 
of absorption was not affected (see <linkHtml href="#section-5.4">CLINICAL 
PHARMACOLOGY: Drug-Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>OVERDOSAGE<paragraph>Symptoms following acute overdoses with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, 
vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive 
care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, 
respiratory depression and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions 
have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, and may occur following an overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following 
overdose with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. There are no specific 
antidotes. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 g to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 
g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen 
within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms, or following a large overdose (5 to 
10 times the usual dose). Forced diuresis, alkalization of urine, hemodialysis, 
or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

individual patient treatment goals (see <linkHtml href="#section-8">WARNINGS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with flurbiprofen, the dose 
and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or 
osteoarthritis, the recommended starting dose of flurbiprofen is 200 mg to 300 
mg per day, divided for administration two, three, or four times a day. The 
largest recommended single dose in a multiple-dose daily regimen is 100 mg.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Aspirin is an NSAID medicine but it does not increase the chance of a heart 
attack. Aspirin can cause bleeding in the brain, stomach, and intestines. 
Aspirin can also cause ulcers in the stomach and intestines. Some of these NSAID 
medicines are sold in lower doses without a prescription (over-the-counter). 
Talk to your healthcare provider before using over-the-counter NSAIDs for more 
than 10 days.</paragraph>
