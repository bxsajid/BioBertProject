                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Pharmacodynamics<paragraph>Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and 
antipyretic activities in animal models. The mechanism of action of diclofenac 
sodium delayed-release tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely 
understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Absorption<paragraph>Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to 
IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass 
metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available. Food has no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption. 
However, there is usually a delay in the onset of absorption of 1 to 4.5 hours 
and a reduction in peak plasma levels of less than 20%.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Distribution<paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac sodium is 
1.4 L/kg.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to 
albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range 
(0.15-105 µg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the 
joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, 
after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than 
plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in 
the effectiveness of diclofenac.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Metabolism<paragraph>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma 
and urine. The metabolites include 4’-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3’-hydroxy-, 
4’,5-dihydroxy- and 3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy diclofenac. In patients with renal 
dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4’-hydroxy- and 
5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after 
single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects. However, 
diclofenac metabolites undergo further glucuronidation and sulfation followed by 
biliary excretion.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One diclofenac metabolite 4’-hydroxy-diclofenac has very weak pharmacologic 
activity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Excretion<paragraph>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent 
urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of 
the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the 
urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 
35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because 
renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged 
diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal 
dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is 
approximately 2 hours.</paragraph>

require reduced doses of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function.</paragraph>

each group), AUC values and elimination rate were comparable to those in healthy 
subjects.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-7">WARNINGS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#section-7.2">Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects</linkHtml>
                     </content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-6">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of 
pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased 
incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have 
impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including 
diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, should be used with caution in 
patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely 
during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of 
therapy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Congestive Heart Failure and Edema Renal Effects<paragraph>Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients 
taking NSAIDs. Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets should be used with 
caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, can 
cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, 
bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large 
intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any 
time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 
one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID 
therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused 
by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in 
about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer 
duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at 
some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not 
without risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. 
Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with 
NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer 
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general 
health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Caution should be used when initiating treatment with diclofenac 
sodium delayed-release tablets in patients with considerable dehydration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis 
and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom 
renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal 
perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, 
secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal 
decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with 
impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking 
diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy 
is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies 
regarding the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in patients with 
advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium 
delayed-release tablets are not recommended in these patients with advanced 
renal disease. If diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets therapy must be 
initiated, close monitoring of the patient’s renal function is advisable.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients without known prior exposure to diclofenac sodium delayed-release 
tablets. Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets should not be given to 
patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in 
asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who 
exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other 
NSAIDs (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-6">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>

                     </content>.) Emergency help should be 
sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, can 
cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can 
be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be 
informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of 
the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any 
other sign of hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diclofenac sodium 
delayed-release tablets should be avoided because it may cause premature closure 
of the ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, cannot be expected to 
substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt 
discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on 
prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a 
decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in 
reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic 
signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful 
conditions.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including diclofenac sodium delayed-release 
tablets. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or 
may be transient with continuing therapy. Based on this experience, in patients 
on chronic treatment with diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, periodic 
monitoring of transaminases is recommended (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-8">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#section-8.6">Laboratory 
Tests</linkHtml>
                     </content>). Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more 
times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 2%-4% of 
patients, including marked elevations (eight or more times the upper limit of 
normal) in about 1% of patients in clinical trials with diclofenac. In addition, 
rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant 
hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes 
have been reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with diclofenac 
sodium delayed-release tablets. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with 
liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, 
rash, etc.), diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets should be 
discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, 
occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon 
erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including 
diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, should have their hemoglobin or 
hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets who may be adversely affected by 
alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or 
patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has 
been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium 
delayed-release tablets should not be administered to patients with this form of 
aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting 
asthma.</paragraph>

lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally 
reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. 
Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, 
but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic 
ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a 
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated 
charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic 
cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with 
symptoms or following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced 
diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be 
useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Laboratory Tests<paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur 
without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI 
bleeding. In patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac 
sodium delayed-release tablets, the CBC and a chemistry profile (including 
transaminase levels) should be checked periodically. If clinical signs and 
symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations 
occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or 
worsen, diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Drug Interactions<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Aspirin<paragraph>When diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are administered 
with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced. The clinical significance of this 
interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant 
administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of 
the potential of increased adverse effects.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Methotrexate<paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance 
the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Cyclosporine<paragraph>Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, like other NSAIDs, may 
affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of certain drugs. 
Therefore, concomitant therapy with diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets 
may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity. Caution should be used when 
diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are administered concomitantly with 
cyclosporine.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>ACE-inhibitors<paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive 
effect of ACE inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in 
patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Furosemide<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have 
shown that diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets can reduce the natriuretic 
effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been 
attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant 
therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal 
failure (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-7">WARNINGS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#section-7.3">Renal Effects</linkHtml>
                     </content>), as well as to assure diuretic 
efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Lithium<paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These 
effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by 
the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects 
should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Warfarin<paragraph>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are 
synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI 
bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Teratogenic Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy Category C<paragraph>Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not 
demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nonteratogenic Effects<paragraph>Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use 
during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Labor and Delivery<paragraph>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed 
parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of diclofenac 
sodium delayed-release tablets on labor and delivery in pregnant women are 
unknown.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for 
serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from diclofenac sodium 
delayed-release tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue 
nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the 
drug to the mother.</paragraph>
