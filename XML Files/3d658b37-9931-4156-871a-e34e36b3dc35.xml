                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacodynamics<paragraph>Flector® Patch applied to intact skin provides local analgesia by 
releasing diclofenac epolamine from the patch into the skin.  Diclofenac is a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  In pharmacologic studies, 
diclofenac has shown anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity.  As 
with other NSAIDs, its mode of action is not known; its ability to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, however, may be involved in its anti-inflammatory 
activity, as well as contribute to its efficacy in relieving pain associated 
with inflammation.</paragraph>

peak plasma concentrations of diclofenac (range 0.7 – 6 ng/mL) were noted 
between 10 – 20 hours of application.  Plasma concentrations of diclofenac in 
the range of 1.3 – 8.8 ng/mL were noted after five days with twice-a-day Flector

at rest or undergoing moderate exercise (cycling 20 min/h for 12 h at a mean HR

                  <paragraph>Efficacy of Flector® Patch was demonstrated in two of four studies of patients 
with minor sprains, strains, and contusions. Patients were randomly assigned to 
treatment with the Flector® Patch, or a placebo patch identical to the Flector® 
Patch minus the active ingredient. In the first of these two studies, patients 
with ankle sprains were treated once daily for a week. In the second study, 
patients with sprains, strains and contusions were treated twice daily for up to 
two weeks.  Pain was assessed over the period of treatment. Patients treated 
with the Flector® Patch experienced a greater reduction in pain as compared to 
patients randomized to placebo patch as evidenced by the responder curves 
presented below.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 
three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) 
thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.  All 
NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk.  
Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater 
risk.  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients 
treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.  
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.  The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs, including Flector® Patch, can lead to onset of new 
hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may 
contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.  Patients taking thiazides 
or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking 
NSAIDs.  NSAIDs, including Flector® Patch, should be used with caution in 
patients with hypertension.  Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely 
during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of 
therapy.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, 
Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including Flector® Patch, can cause serious 
gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, 
ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, 
which can be fatal.  These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or 
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.  Only one in five 
patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is 
symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs 
occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% 
of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of 
use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time 
during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without 
risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding </content>who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors.  
Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with 
NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer 
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general 
health status.  Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration.  Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected.  This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out.  For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury.  Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion.  In these patients, administration of a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation.  Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly.  
Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies 
regarding the use of Flector® Patch in patients with advanced renal disease.  
Therefore, treatment with Flector® Patch is not recommended in these patients 
with advanced renal disease.  If Flector® Patch therapy is initiated, close 
monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients without known prior exposure to Flector® Patch. Flector® Patch should 
not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically 
occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal 
polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking 
aspirin or other NSAIDs (see<content styleCode="bold">

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including Flector® Patch, can cause serious skin adverse 
events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur 
without warning.  Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of 
serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the 
first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Flector® Patch cannot be expected to substitute for 
corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation 
of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is 
made to discontinue corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of Flector® Patch in reducing inflammation may 
diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of 
presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including Flector® Patch. These laboratory 
abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with 
continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or 
more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of 
patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe 
hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver 
necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been 
reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with Flector® 
Patch. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or 
if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), Flector® 
Patch should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may 
be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely 
described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with 
NSAIDs, including Flector® Patch, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit 
checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.  Patients receiving 
Flector® Patch who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet 
function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving 
anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has 
been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Flector® Patch should not be 
administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be 
used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Eye Exposure<paragraph>Contact of Flector® Patch with eyes and mucosa, although not 
studied, should be avoided.  If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye 
with water or saline.  Consult a physician if irritation persists for more than 
an hour.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Accidental Exposure in Children<paragraph>Even a used Flector® Patch contains a large amount of diclofenac 
epolamine (as much as 170 mg).  The potential therefore exists for a small child 
or pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used 
Flector® Patch.  It is important for patients to store and dispose of Flector® 
Patch out of the reach of children and pets.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in 
renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% 
and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have 
been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. 
Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be 
observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>

in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity 
of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered 
concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were administered 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day 
diclofenac epolamine via oral gavage (males treated for 60 days prior to 
conception and during mating period, females treated for 14 days prior to mating 
through day 19 of gestation).  Diclofenac epolamine treatment with 6 mg/kg/day 
resulted in increased early resorptions and postimplantation losses; however, no 
effects on the mating and fertility indices were found.  The 6 mg/kg/day dose 
corresponds to 3-times the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on 
a body surface area comparison.</paragraph>

diclofenac epolamine via oral gavage daily from gestation days 6-15.  Maternal 
toxicity, embryotoxicity, and increased incidence of skeletal anomalies were 
noted with 6 mg/kg/day diclofenac epolamine, which corresponds to 3-times the 
maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area 
comparison.  Pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were administered 1, 3, or 6 
mg/kg diclofenac epolamine vial oral gavage daily from gestation days 6-18.  No 
maternal toxicity was noted; however, embryotoxicity was evident at 6 mg/kg/day

humans based on a body surface area comparison.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Flector

drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use 
during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Male rats were orally administered diclofenac epolamine (1, 3, 6 mg/kg) for 
60 days prior to mating and throughout the mating period, and females were given 
the same doses 14 days prior to mating and through mating, gestation, and 
lactation.  Embryotoxicity was observed at 6 mg/kg diclofenac epolamine (3-times 
the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area 
comparison), and was manifested as an increase in early resorptions, 
post-implantation losses, and a decrease in live fetuses. The number of live 
born and total born were also reduced as was F1 postnatal survival, but the 
physical and behavioral development of surviving F1 pups in all groups was the 
same as the deionized water control, nor was reproductive performance adversely 
affected despite a slight treatment-related reduction in body weight.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Use<paragraph>Clinical studies of Flector® Patch did not include sufficient 
numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond 
differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not 
identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diclofenac, as with any NSAID, is known to be substantially excreted by the 
kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to Flector® Patch may be greater in 
patients with impaired renal function.  Because elderly patients are more likely 
to have decreased renal function, care should be taken when using Flector® Patch 
in the elderly, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</paragraph>

Treatment<paragraph>In the controlled trials, 3% of patients in both the Flector® 
Patch and placebo patch groups discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.  
The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were application site 
reactions, occurring in 2% of both the Flector® Patch and placebo patch groups.  
Application site reactions leading to dropout included pruritus, dermatitis, and 
burning.</paragraph>
