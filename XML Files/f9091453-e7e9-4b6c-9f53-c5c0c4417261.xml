                  <paragraph>The active ingredient in ibuprofen suspension is ibuprofen, which 
is a member of the propionic acid group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of [+]S- and [-]R-enantiomers. It is a 
white to off-white crystalline powder, with a melting point of 74° to 77°C. It 
is practically insoluble in water (&lt;0.1 mg/mL), but readily soluble in 
organic solvents such as ethanol and acetone. Ibuprofen has a pKa of 4.43±0.03 
and an n-octanol/water partition coefficient of 11.7 at pH 7.4. The chemical 
name for ibuprofen is (±)-2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid. The molecular 
weight of ibuprofen is 206.28. Its molecular formula is C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>18</sub>0<sub>2</sub> and it 
has the following structural formula:</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacodynamics<paragraph>Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that 
possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Its mode of 
action, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood, but may be 
related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. After absorption of the racemic 
ibuprofen, the [-]R-enantiomer undergoes interconversion to the [+]S-form. The 
biological activities of ibuprofen are associated with the 
[+]S-enantiomer.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pharmacokinetics<paragraph>Ibuprofen is a racemic mixture of [-]R-and [+]S-isomers. <content styleCode="italics">In vivo</content> and <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies 
indicate that the [+]S-isomer is responsible for clinical activity. The 
[-]R-form, while thought to be pharmacologically inactive, is slowly and 
incompletely (~60%) interconverted into the active [+]S species in adults. The 
degree of interconversion in children is unknown, but is thought to be similar. 
The [-]R-isomer serves as a circulating reservoir to maintain levels of active 
drug. Ibuprofen is well absorbed orally, with less than 1% being excreted in the 
urine unchanged. It has a biphasic elimination time curve with a plasma 
half-life of approximately 2 hours. Studies in febrile children have established 
the dose-proportionality of 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of ibuprofen. Studies in adults 
have established the dose-proportionality of ibuprofen as a single oral dose 
from 50 to 600 mg for total drug and up to 1200 mg for free drug.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Antacids<paragraph>A bioavailability study in adults has shown that there was no 
interference with the absorption of ibuprofen when given in conjunction with an 
antacid containing both aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>H-2 Antagonists<paragraph>In studies with human volunteers, coadministration of cimetidine 
or ranitidine with ibuprofen had no substantive effect on ibuprofen serum 
concentrations.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Food Effects<paragraph>Absorption is most rapid when ibuprofen is given under fasting 
conditions. Administration of ibuprofen suspension with food affects the rate 
but not the extent of absorption. When taken with food, T<sub>max</sub> is delayed by approximately 30 to 60 minutes, and peak 
levels are reduced by approximately 30 to 50%.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Distribution<paragraph>Ibuprofen, like most drugs of its class, is highly protein bound 
(&gt;99% bound at 20 µg/mL). Protein binding is saturable and at concentrations &gt;20 µg/mL binding is non-linear. Based on oral dosing data there is an age- 
or fever-related change in volume of distribution for ibuprofen. Febrile 
children &lt;11 years old have a volume of approximately 0.2 L/kg while adults 
have a volume of approximately 0.12 L/kg. The clinical significance of these 
findings is unknown.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Metabolism<paragraph>Following oral administration, the majority of the dose was 
recovered in the urine within 24 hours as the hydroxy-(25%) and 
carboxypropyl-(37%) phenylpropionic acid metabolites. The percentages of free 
and conjugated ibuprofen found in the urine were approximately 1% and 14%, 
respectively. The remainder of the drug was found in the stool as both 
metabolites and unabsorbed drug.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Elimination<paragraph>Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine. The 
excretion of ibuprofen is virtually complete 24 hours after the last dose. It 
has a biphasic plasma elimination time curve with a half-life of approximately 
2.0 hours. There is no difference in the observed terminal elimination rate or 
half-life between children and adults, however, there is an age-or fever-related 
change in total clearance. This suggests that the observed change in clearance 
is due to changes in the volume of distribution of ibuprofen (see <linkHtml href="#T1">Table 1</linkHtml> for CI/F values).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Clinical Studies<paragraph>Controlled clinical trials comparing doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg 
ibuprofen suspension and 10-15 mg/kg of acetaminophen elixir have been conducted 
in children 6 months to 12 years of age with fever primarily due to viral 
illnesses. In these studies there were no differences between treatments in 
fever reduction for the first hour and maximum fever reduction occurred between 
2 and 4 hours. Response after 1 hour was dependent on both the level of 
temperature elevation as well as the treatment. In children with baseline 
temperatures at or below 102.5°F both ibuprofen doses and acetaminophen were 
equally effective in their maximum effect. In children with temperatures above 
102.5°F, the ibuprofen 10 mg/kg dose was more effective. By 6 hours, children 
treated with ibuprofen 5mg/kg tended to have recurrence of fever, whereas 
children treated with ibuprofen 10 mg/kg still had significant fever reduction 
at 8 hours. In control groups treated with 10 mg/kg acetaminophen, fever 
reduction resembled that seen in children treated with 5 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 
with the exception that temperature elevation tended to return 1-2 hours 
earlier. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with primary dysmenorrhea, ibuprofen has been shown to reduce 
elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrual fluid and to reduce 
testing and active intrauterine pressure, as well as the frequency of uterine 
contractions. The probable mechanism of action is to inhibit prostaglandin 
synthesis rather than simply to provide analgesia.</paragraph>

asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other 
NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDS have been 
reported in such patients (see <content styleCode="bold">

Events</content>
                  <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV 
events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <content styleCode="bold">

                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the

                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including ibuprofen suspension, can lead to onset of new 
hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may 
contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or 
loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. 
NSAIDs, including ibuprofen suspension, should be used with caution in patients 
with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the 
initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, 
Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including ibuprofen suspension, can cause serious 
gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, 
ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, 
which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or 
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five 
patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is 
symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs 
occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% 
of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of 
use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time 
during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without 
risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a 
GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors 
that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include 
concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of 
NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health 
status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Renal Effects<paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. 
Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Advanced Renal Disease<paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies 
regarding the use of ibuprofen suspension in patients with advanced renal 
disease. Therefore, treatment with ibuprofen suspension is not recommended in 
these patients with advanced renal disease. If ibuprofen suspension therapy must 
be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is 
advisable.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Anaphylactoid Reactions<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients without known prior exposure to ibuprofen suspension. Ibuprofen 
suspension should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom 
complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or 
without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm 
after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-7">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>

                     </content>). Emergency help 
should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Skin Reactions<paragraph>NSAIDs, including ibuprofen suspension, can cause serious skin 
adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), 
and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events 
may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and 
symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be 
discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of 
hypersensitivity.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<paragraph>In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen should be 
avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>General<paragraph>Ibuprofen suspension cannot be expected to substitute for 
corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation 
of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged 
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is 
made to discontinue corticosteroids. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of ibuprofen suspension in reducing fever and 
inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting 
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen suspension. These 
laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient 
with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three 
or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% 
of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe 
hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver 
necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been 
reported. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ibuprofen 
suspension. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease 
develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), 
ibuprofen suspension should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including 
ibuprofen suspension. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI 
blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on 
long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including ibuprofen suspension, should have 
their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of 
anemia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreased hemoglobin 
level was greater than previously reported. Decrease in hemoglobin of 1 gram or 
more was observed in 17.1% of 193 patients on 1600 mg ibuprofen daily 
(osteoarthritis), and in 22.8% of 189 patients taking 2400 mg of ibuprofen daily 
(rheumatoid arthritis). Positive stool occult blood tests and elevated serum 
creatinine levels were also observed in these studies.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding 
time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
ibuprofen suspension who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet 
function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving 
anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has 
been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ibuprofen suspension should 
not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should 
be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Aseptic Meningitis<paragraph>Aseptic meningitis, with fever and coma, has been observed on 
rare occasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probably more 
likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related 
connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an 
underlying chronic disease.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diabetics<paragraph>Ibuprofen suspension contains 270 mg high fructose corn syrup and 
2.43 calories per mL, or 1350 mg high fructose corn syrup and 12.15 calories per 
teaspoonful, which should be taken into consideration when treating diabetic 
patients with this product.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive 
effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in 
patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <content styleCode="italics">Aspirin</content>
                  <paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of IBUPROFEN and 
aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased 
adverse effects.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Diuretics<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have 
shown that ibuprofen suspension can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide 
and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition 
of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the 
patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-8.3">WARNINGS - Renal Effects</linkHtml>
                     </content>), as well 
as to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Lithium<paragraph>Ibuprofen produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteers. The 
mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance of 
lithium was decreased by 19% during this period of concomitant drug 
administration. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal 
prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when ibuprofen and lithium are 
administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of 
lithium toxicity. (Read circulars for lithium preparation before use of such 
concurrent therapy.)</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Methotrexate<paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance 
the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are 
administered concomitantly with methotrexate.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Warfarin<paragraph>Several short-term controlled studies failed to show that 
ibuprofen significantly affected prothrombin times or a variety of other 
clotting factors when administered to individuals on warfarin-type 
anticoagulants. However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and 
other NSAIDs have been administered to patients on warfarin-type anticoagulants, 
the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on 
anticoagulants. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are 
synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious 
GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Teratogenic Effects<linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pregnancy Category C<paragraph>Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not 
demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ibuprofen should be used 
in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
fetus.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nonteratogenic Effects<paragraph>Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use 
during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Labor and Delivery<paragraph>In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit 
prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed 
parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of ibuprofen 
suspension on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Therefore, 
administration of ibuprofen suspension is not recommended during labor and 
delivery.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Nursing Mothers<paragraph>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. 
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for 
serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ibuprofen suspension, a 
decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the 
drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Pediatric Use<paragraph>Safety and effectiveness of ibuprofen suspension in pediatric 
patients below the age of 6 months have not been established (see <linkHtml href="#section-5.10">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Clinical Studies</linkHtml>). Dosing of 
ibuprofen suspension in children 6 months or older should be guided by their 
body weight (see <linkHtml href="#section-12">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>
                  <linkHtml href=""/>Geriatric Use<paragraph>As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the 
elderly (65 years and older).</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The toxicity of ibuprofen overdose is dependent upon the amount 
of drug ingested and the time elapsed since ingestion, though individual 
response may vary, which makes it necessary to evaluate each case individually. 
Although uncommon, serious toxicity and death have been reported in the medical 
literature with ibuprofen overdosage. The most frequently reported symptoms of 
ibuprofen overdose include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy and 
drowsiness. Other central nervous system symptoms include headache, tinnitus, 
CNS depression and seizures. Metabolic acidosis, coma, acute renal failure and 
apnea (primarily in very young children) may rarely occur. Cardiovascular 
toxicity, including hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia and atrial 
fibrillation, also have been reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The treatment of acute ibuprofen overdose is primarily supportive. Management 
of hypotension, acidosis and gastrointestinal bleeding may be necessary. In 
cases of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied through ipecac-induced 
emesis or lavage. Emesis is most effective if initiated within 30 minutes of 
ingestion. Orally administered activated charcoal may help in reducing the 
absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In children, the estimated amount of ibuprofen ingested per body weight may 
be helpful to predict the potential for development of toxicity although each 
case must be evaluated. Ingestion of less than 100 mg/kg is unlikely to produce 
toxicity. Children ingesting 100 to 200 mg/kg may be managed with induced emesis 
and a minimal observation time of four hours. Children ingesting 200 to 400 
mg/kg of ibuprofen should have immediate gastric emptying and at least four 
hours observation in a health care facility. Children ingesting greater than 400 
mg/kg require immediate medical referral, careful observation and appropriate 
supportive therapy. Ipecac-induced emesis is not recommended in overdoses 
greater than 400 mg/kg because of the risk for convulsions and the potential for 
aspiration of gastric contents. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In adult patients the history of the dose reportedly ingested does not appear 
to be predictive of toxicity. The need for referral and follow-up must be judged 
by the circumstances at the time of the overdose ingestion. Symptomatic adults 
should be carefully evaluated, observed and supported.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ibuprofen 
suspension and other treatment options before deciding to use ibuprofen

                  <paragraph>For reduction of fever in children, 6 months up to 2 years of 
age, the dosage should be adjusted on the basis of the initial temperature level 
(see <linkHtml href="#section-5">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>). The recommended dose is 5 
mg/kg if the baseline temperature is less than 102.5°F, or 10 mg/kg if the 
baseline temperature is 102.5°F or greater. The duration of fever reduction is 
generally 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg.</paragraph>

four doses (see <linkHtml href="#section-12.2.3">Individualization of Dosage</linkHtml>). 
Patients with milder disease may be adequately treated with 20 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with juvenile arthritis, doses above 50 mg/kg/day are not 
recommended because they have not been studied and doses exceeding the upper 
recommended dose of 40 mg/kg/day may increase the risk of causing serious 
adverse events. The therapeutic response may require from a few days to several 
weeks to be achieved. Once a clinical effect is obtained, the dosage should be 
lowered to the smallest dose of ibuprofen needed to maintain adequate control of 
symptoms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pediatric patients receiving doses above 30 mg/kg/day or if abnormal liver 
function tests have occurred with previous NSAID treatments should be carefully 
followed for signs and symptoms of early liver dysfunction.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The dose of ibuprofen suspension should be tailored to each 
patient, and may be lowered or raised from the suggested doses depending on the 
severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy or as the patient 
responds or fails to respond.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One fever study showed that, after the initial dose of ibuprofen suspension, 
subsequent doses may be lowered and still provide adequate fever control.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a situation when low fever would require the ibuprofen suspension 5 mg/kg 
dose in a child with pain, the dose that will effectively treat the predominant 
symptom should be chosen.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to ibuprofen suspension therapy 
is sometimes seen in a few days to a week, but most often is observed by two 
weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose 
should be reviewed and adjusted as required.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses than do 
patients with osteoarthritis. The smallest dose of ibuprofen suspension that 
yields acceptable control should be employed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ibuprofen suspension may be used in combination with gold salts and/or 
corticosteroids.</paragraph>
