                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is a non-steroidal drug with anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties. Its mode of action, like that of other anti-inflammatory drugs, is not known. However, its therapeutic action is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis 
       
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Concentrations are reached during therapy which have been demonstrated to have an effect 
       
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>as well. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Moreover, prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of inflammation. Since indomethacin is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, appropriate for long-term use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoarthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin affords relief of symptoms; it does not alter the progressive course of the underlying disease.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin suppresses inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis as demonstrated by relief of pain, and reduction of fever, swelling and tenderness. Improvement in patients treated with indomethacin for rheumatoid arthritis has been demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, average number of joints involved, and morning stiffness; by increased mobility as demonstrated by a decrease in walking time; and by improved functional capability as demonstrated by an increase in grip strength.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin has been reported to diminish basal and CO
       
 
  <sub>2</sub> stimulated cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers following acute oral and intravenous administration. In one study after one week of treatment with orally administered indomethacin, this effect on basal cerebral blood flow had disappeared. The clinical significance of this effect has not been established.
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules (75 mg) are designed to release 25 mg of drug initially and the remaining 50 mg over approximately 12 hours (90% of dose absorbed by 12 hours). Plasma concentrations of Indomethacin fluctuates less and are more sustained following administration of Indomethacin Extended–Release Capsules than following administration of 25 mg indomethacin capsules given at 4 to 6 hours Intervals. In multiple dose comparisons, the mean daily steady plasma levels of Indomethacin attained with daily administration of Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules 75 mg was indistinguishable from that following Indomethacin 25 mg Capsules given at 0, 6, and 12 hours daily. However, there was a significant difference in Indomethacin plasma levels between the two dosage regimens especially after 12 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Controlled clinical studies of safety and efficacy in patients with osteoarthritis have shown that one capsule of Indomethacin Extended-Release was clinically comparable to one 25 mg indomethacin capsule t.i.d.; and in controlled clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, one capsule of Indomethacin Extended-Release taken in the morning and one in the evening were clinically indistinguishable from one 50 mg capsule of indomethacin t.i.d.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin is eliminated via renal excretion, metabolism, and biliary excretion. Indomethacn undergoes appreciable enterohepatic circulation. The mean half-life of indomethacin is estimated to be about 4.5 hours. With a typical therapeutic regimen of 25 or 50 mg t.i.d., the steady state plasma concentrations of indomethacin are an average 1.4 times those following the first dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin exists in the plasma as the parent drug and its desmethyl, desbenzoyl, and desmethyl-desbenzoyl metabolites, all in the unconjugated form. About 60 percent of an oral dosage is recovered in urine as drug and metabolites (26 percent as indomethacin and its glucuronide), and 33 percent is recovered in feces (1.5 percent as indomethacin).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>About 99% of indomethacin is bound to protein in plasma over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Indomethacin has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules, USP and other treatment options before deciding to use Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules, USP. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see

                  <paragraph>Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules, USP have been found effective in active stages of the following:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>1. Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>2. Moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>3. Moderate to sever osteoarthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>4. Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendonitis).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules, USP are not recommended for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indomethacin may enable the reduction of steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more sever forms of rheumatoid arthritis. In such instances the steroid dosage should be reduced slowly and the patients followed very closely for any possible adverse effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The use of indomethacin in conjunction with aspirin or other salicylates is not recommended. Controlled clinical studies have shown that the combined use of indomethacin and aspirin does not product any greater therapeutic effect than the use of indomethacin alone. Furthermore, in one of these clinical studies, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was significantly increased with combined therapy. (see

                  <paragraph>Clinical trails of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDS of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with a NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and a NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see

                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including Indomethacin Extended Release Capsules, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestines, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who development a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a 
       
 
  <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDS include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk of an adverse GI event in patients treated with a NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The adverse reactions for indomethacin capsules listed in the following table have been arranged into two groups: 1) incidence greater than 1% and (2) incidence less than 1%. The incidence for group (1) was obtained from 33 doubleblind controlled clinical trails reported in the literature (1,092 patients). The incidence for group (2) was based on reports in clinical trials, in the literature, and on voluntary reports since marketing. The probability of a causal relationship exists between indomethacin and these adverse reactions, some of which have been reported only rarely.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials, the incidence of adverse reactions to Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules and equal 24-hour doses of indomethacin capsules were similar.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The stomach should be emptied as quickly as possible if the ingestion is recent. If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously, the patient should be induced to vomit with syrup of Ipecac. If the patient is unable to vomit, gastric lavage should be performed. Once the stomach has been emptied, 25 or 50 g of activated charcoal may be given. Depending on the condition of the patient, close medical observation and nursing care may be required. The patient should be followed for several days because gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhage have been reported as adverse reactions of indomethacin. Use of antacids may be helpful.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules.

                  <paragraph>Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules 75 mg are available for oral use. Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules can be administered once a day and can be substituted for indomethacin 25 mg capsules t.i.d. However, there will be significant difference between the two dosage regimens in indomethacin blood levels, especially after 12 hours (see 
       
 
  <linkHtml href="#bb04c516-0f02-4012-b220-445470def5f9">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>). In addition, Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules 75 mg b.i.d. can be substituted for indomethacin 50 mg capsules t.i.d. Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules may be substituted for all the indications of indomethacin capsules except acute gouty arthritis.
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Adverse reactions appear to correlate with the size of the dose of indomethacin in most patients, but not all. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine the smallest effective dosage for the individual patient.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Always give Indomethacin Extended-Release Capsules 75 mg with food, immediately after meals, or with antacids to reduce gastric irritation.</paragraph>
