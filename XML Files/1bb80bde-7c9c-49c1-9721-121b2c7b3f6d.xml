               <text>
                  <paragraph>Studies in animals have shown tolmetin sodium to possess 
anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. In the rat, tolmetin 
prevents the development of experimentally induced polyarthritis and also 
decreases established inflammation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mode of action of tolmetin is not known. However, studies in laboratory 
animals and man have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory action of tolmetin 
is <content styleCode="italics">not</content> due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation. Tolmetin 
inhibits prostaglandin synthetase <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> and lowers 
the plasma level of prostaglandin E in man. This reduction in prostaglandin 
synthesis may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action. Tolmetin does not 
appear to alter the course of the underlying disease in man.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in normal volunteers, tolmetin 
sodium is rapidly and almost completely absorbed with peak plasma levels being 
reached within 30 to 60 minutes after an oral therapeutic dose. In controlled 
studies, the time to reach peak tolmetin plasma concentration is approximately 
20 minutes longer following administration of a 600 mg tablet, compared to an 
equivalent dose given as 200 mg tablets. The clinical meaningfulness of this 
finding, if any, is unknown. Tolmetin displays a biphasic elimination from the 
plasma consisting of a rapid phase with a half-life of 1 to 2 hours followed by 
a slower phase with a half-life of about 5 hours. Peak plasma levels of 
approximately 40 mcg/mL are obtained with a 400 mg oral dose. Essentially all of 
the administered dose is recovered in the urine in 24 hours either as an 
inactive oxidative metabolite or as conjugates of tolmetin. An 18-day 
multiple-dose study demonstrated no accumulation of tolmetin when compared with 
a single dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In two fecal blood loss studies of 4 to 6 days duration involving 15 subjects 
each, tolmetin did not induce an increase in blood loss over that observed 
during a 4-day drug free control period. In the same studies, aspirin produced a 
greater blood loss than occurred during the drug free control period, and a 
greater blood loss than occurred during the tolmetin sodium treatment period. In 
one of the two studies, indomethacin produced a greater fecal blood loss than 
occurred during the drug free control period; in the second study, indomethacin 
did not induce a significant increase in blood loss.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Tolmetin is effective in treating both the acute flares and in the long-term 
management of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, tolmetin is 
as effective as aspirin and indomethacin in controlling disease activity, but 
the frequency of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects and tinnitus was 
less than in aspirin-treated patients, and the incidence of central nervous 
system adverse effects was less than in indomethacin-treated patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, tolmetin is as effective as 
aspirin in controlling disease activity, with a similar incidence of adverse 
reactions. Mean SGOT values, initially elevated in patients on previous aspirin 
therapy, remained elevated in the aspirin group and decreased in the tolmetin 
group.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Tolmetin has produced additional therapeutic benefit when added to a regimen 
of gold salts and, to a lesser extent, with corticosteroids. Tolmetin should not 
be used in conjunction with salicylates since greater benefit from the 
combination is not likely, but the potential for adverse reactions is increased.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective 
NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which 
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a 
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may 
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in 
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the 
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the 
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. 
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events 
and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <linkHtml href="#section-">  WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal 
(GI) Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <linkHtml href="#section-">  CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                  <br/>Hypertension<paragraph>NSAIDs, including tolmetin, can lead to onset of new hypertension 
or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the 
increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics 
may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, 
including tolmetin, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. 
Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID 
treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation<paragraph>NSAIDs, including tolmetin, can cause serious gastrointestinal 
adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of 
the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These 
serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms 
in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious 
upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross 
bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients 
treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one 
year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the 
likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of 
therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a <content styleCode="italics">prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal 
bleeding</content> who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for 
developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. 
Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with 
NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer 
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general 
health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or 
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating 
this population.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is 
suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI 
adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do 
not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Acute interstitial nephritis with 
hematuria, proteinuria, and occasionally nephrotic syndrome have been reported 
in patients treated with tolmetin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins 
have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these 
patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors and the elderly. 
Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in 
patients with known prior exposure to tolmetin. Tolmetin should not be given to 
patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in 
asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who 
exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other 
NSAIDs (see <linkHtml href="#section-">  CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>

                  <paragraph>Tolmetin cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or 
to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids 
may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy 
should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue 
corticosteroids.</paragraph>

                  <br/>Opthalmological Effects<paragraph>Because of ocular changes observed in animals and of reports of 
adverse eye findings with NSAIDs, it is recommended that patients who develop 
visual disturbances during treatment with tolmetin have ophthalmologic 
evaluations.</paragraph>

                  <br/>Hepatic Effects<paragraph>Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up 
to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including tolmetin. These laboratory 
abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with 
continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or 
more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of 
patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe 
hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver 
necrosis, and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been 
reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom 
an abnormal liver test has occurred should be evaluated for evidence of the 
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with tolmetin. If 
clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if 
systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), tolmetin should 
be discontinued.</paragraph>

                  <br/>Hematological Effects<paragraph>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs including 
tolmetin. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or 
an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term 
treatment with NSAIDs, including tolmetin, should have their hemoglobin or 
hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs 
inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in 
some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is 
quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving 
tolmetin who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such 
as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should 
be carefully monitored.</paragraph>

                  <linkHtml href="#section-"/>
                  <br/>Preexisting Asthma<paragraph>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use 
of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with 
severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including 
bronchospasm, between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such 
aspirin-sensitive patients, tolmetin should not be administered to patients with 
this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients 
with preexisting asthma.</paragraph>

                        <br/>Aspirin<paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of tolmetin 
sodium and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of 
increased adverse effects.</paragraph>

                        <br/>Diuretics<paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations have 
shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides 
in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal 
prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient 
should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure 
diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>

                        <br/>Lithium<paragraph>NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a 
reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration 
increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These 
effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by 
the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects 
should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>

                        <br/>Methotrexate<paragraph>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate 
accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance 
the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are

                        <br/>Warfarin<paragraph>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are 
synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI 
bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> binding of warfarin to human plasma 
proteins is unaffected by tolmetin, and tolmetin does not alter the prothrombin 
time of normal volunteers. However, increased prothrombin time and bleeding have 
been reported in patients on concomitant tolmetin and warfarin therapy. 
Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering tolmetin to patients 
on anticoagulants.</paragraph>

                        <br/>Pregnancy Category C<paragraph>Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 50 mg/kg 
(1.5 times the maximum clinical dose based on a body weight of 60 kg) revealed 
no evidence of teratogenesis or impaired fertility due to tolmetin. However, 
animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There 
are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Tolmetin should 
be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
to the fetus.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The adverse reactions which have been observed in clinical trials 
encompass observations in about 4,370 patients treated with tolmetin sodium, 
over 800 of whom have undergone at least one year of therapy. These adverse 
reactions, reported below by body system, are among those typical of 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, as expected, gastrointestinal 
complaints were most frequent. In clinical trials with tolmetin, about 10% of 
patients dropped out because of adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal in 
nature.</paragraph>

               <title>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of tolmetin 
and other treatment options before deciding to use tolmetin sodium. Use the 
lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual 
patient treatment goals (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_warnings_id_warn">WARNINGS</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After observing the response to initial therapy with tolmetin sodium, the 
dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, the recommended 
starting dose for adults is 400 mg three times daily (1200 mg daily), preferably 
including a dose on arising and a dose at bedtime. To achieve optimal 
therapeutic effect the dose should be adjusted according to the patient's 
response after 1 or 2 weeks. Control is usually achieved at doses of 600 mg to 
1800 mg daily in divided doses (generally t.i.d.). Doses larger than 1800 mg/day 
have not been studied and are not recommended.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the relief of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting 
dose for pediatric patients (2 years and older) is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses 
(t.i.d. or q.i.d.). When control has been achieved, the usual dose ranges from 
15 to 30 mg/kg/day. Doses higher than 30 mg/kg/day have not been studied, and, 
therefore, are not recommended.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A therapeutic response to tolmetin sodium can be expected in a few days to a 
week. Progressive improvement can be anticipated during succeeding weeks of 
therapy. If gastrointestinal symptoms occur, tolmetin can be administered with 
antacids other than sodium bicarbonate. Tolmetin sodium bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by acute or chronic 
administration of magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, bioavailability is 
affected by food or milk (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_prec-dfint">PRECAUTIONS: 
Drug-Food Interaction</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
