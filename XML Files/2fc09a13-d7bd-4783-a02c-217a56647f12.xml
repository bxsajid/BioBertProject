                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that 
exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties in animal 
models. The mechanism of action of oxaprozin, like that of other NSAIDs, is not 
completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase 
inhibition.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Distribution: In dose proportionality studies 
utilizing 600, 1200 and 1800 mg doses, the pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin in 
healthy subjects demonstrated nonlinear kinetics of both the total and unbound 
drug in opposite directions, i.e., dose exposure related increase in the 
clearance of total drug and decrease in the clearance of the unbound drug. 
Decreased clearance of the unbound drug was related predominantly to a decrease 
in the volume of distribution and not an increase in the half-life. This 
phenomenon is considered to have minimal impact on drug accumulation upon 
multiple dosing<content styleCode="bold">.</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of total oxaprozin is 
approximately 11-17 L/70 kg. Oxaprozin is 99% bound to plasma proteins, 
primarily to albumin. At therapeutic drug concentrations, the plasma protein 
binding of oxaprozin is saturable, resulting in a higher proportion of the free 
drug as the total drug concentration is increased. With increases in single 
doses or following repetitive once-daily dosing, the apparent volume of 
distribution and clearance of total drug increased, while that of unbound drug 
decreased due to the effects of nonlinear protein binding. Oxaprozin penetrates 
into synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis patients with oxaprozin 
concentrations 2-fold and 3-fold greater than in plasma and synovial fluid, 
respectively. Oxaprozin is expected to be excreted in human milk based on its 
physical-chemical properties, however, the amount of oxaprozin excreted in 
breast milk has not been evaluated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metabolism: Several oxaprozin metabolites have been 
identified in human urine or feces.Oxaprozin is primarily metabolized by the 
liver, by both microsomal oxidation (65%) and glucuronic acid conjugation (35%). 
Ester and ether glucuronide are the major conjugated metabolites of oxaprozin. 
On chronic dosing, metabolites do not accumulate in the plasma of patients with 
normal renal function. Concentrations of the metabolites in plasma are very 
low.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin’s metabolites do not have significant pharmacologic activity. The 
major ester and ether glucuronide conjugated metabolites have been evaluated 
along with oxaprozin in receptor binding studies and in vivo animal models and 
have demonstrated no activity. A small amount (less than 5%) of active phenolic 
metabolites are produced, but the contribution to overall activity is 
limited.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Excretion: Approximately 5% of the oxaprozin dose is 
excreted unchanged in the urine.Sixty-five percent (65%) of the dose is excreted 
in the urine and 35% in the feces as metabolite. Biliary excretion of unchanged 
oxaprozin is a minor pathway, and enterohepatic recycling of oxaprozin is 
insignificant. Upon chronic dosing the accumulation half-life is approximately 
22 hours. The elimination half-life is approximately twice the accumulation 
half-life due to increased binding and decreased clearance at lower 
concentrations.<content styleCode="bold"/>

pharmacokinetic study indicated no clinically important age dependent changes in 
the apparent clearance of unbound oxaprozin between adult rheumatoid arthritis 
patients (N=40) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) patients (≥ 6 years, 
N=44) when adjustments were made for differences in body weight between these 
patient groups. The extent of protein binding of oxaprozin at various 
therapeutic total plasma concentrations was also similar between the adult and 
pediatric patient groups. Pharmacokinetic model-based estimates of daily 
exposure (AUC0-24) to unbound oxaprozin in JRA patients relative to adult 
rheumatoid arthritis patients suggest dose to body weight range relationships as 
shown in Table 2. No pharmacokinetic data are available for pediatric patients

                  <paragraph>Renal Insufficiency: The pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin 
have been investigated in patients with renal insufficiency. Oxaprozin’s renal 
clearance decreased proportionally with creatinine clearance (CrCl), but since 
only about 5% of oxaprozin dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, the decrease 
in total body clearance becomes clinically important only in those subjects with 
highly decreased CrCl. Oxaprozin is not significantly removed from the blood in 
patients undergoing hemodialysis or CAPD due to its high protein binding. 
Oxaprozin plasma protein binding may decrease in patients with severe renal 
deficiency. Dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with renal 
insufficiency (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects).<content styleCode="bold">

                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin was evaluated for managing the signs and symptoms of 
rheumatoid arthritis in placebo and active controlled clinical trials in a total 
of 646 patients. Oxaprozin was given in single or divided daily doses of 600 to 
1800 mg/day and was found to be comparable to 2600 to 3900 mg/day of aspirin. At 
these doses there was a trend (over all trials) for oxaprozin to be more 
effective and cause fewer gastrointestinal side effects than aspirin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oxaprozin was given as a once-a-day dose of 1200 mg in most of the clinical 
trials, but larger doses (up to 26 mg/kg or 1800 mg/day) were used in selected 
patients. In some patients, oxaprozin may be better tolerated in divided doses. 
Due to its long half-life, several days of oxaprozin therapy were needed for the

                  <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 
three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) 
thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All 
NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients 
with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To 
minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an 
NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration 
possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of 
such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be 
informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to 
take if they occur. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the 
increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The 
concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI 
events (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects -Risk of 
Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation</content>). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the 
treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an 
increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see <content styleCode="bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</content>). </paragraph>

worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the 
increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics 
may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, 
including oxaprozin, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. 
Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID 
treatment and throughout the course of therapy. </paragraph>

Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation </content>
                  <paragraph>NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause serious gastrointestinal 
(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and 
perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be 
fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without 
warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, 
who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. 
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in 
approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of 
patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of 
use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time 
during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without 
risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior 
history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior 
history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs 
have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to 
patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase 
the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use 
of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, 
smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most 
spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients 
and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated 
with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest 
possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and 
symptoms of GI ulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly 
initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. 
This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse 
event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not 
involve NSAIDs should be considered. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal 
papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in 
patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the 
maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose dependent reduction in 
prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may 
precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this 
reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver 
dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. 
Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the 
pretreatment state. </paragraph>

                           <item>Oxaprozin, like other NSAIDs, may cause CV side effects, such as MI or 
stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV 
events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the 
signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of 
speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or 
symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see

GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in 
hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and 
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the 
signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical 
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, 
dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the

exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and 
even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients 
should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or 
other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical 
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be

                        <paragraph>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning 
symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs of symptoms of GI bleeding. 
Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a 
chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur 
(e.g. eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, 
oxaprozin should be discontinued. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="bold"/>Concomitant administration of oxaprozin and aspirin 
is not recommended because oxaprozin displaces salicylates from plasma protein 
binding sites. Coadministration would be expected to increase the risk of 
salicylate toxicity. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of oxaprozin and aspirin is 
not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse 
effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methotrexate</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="bold"/>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit 
methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they 
could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs 
are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Coadministration of oxaprozin 
with methotrexate results in approximately a 36% reduction in apparent oral 
clearance of methotrexate. A reduction in methotrexate dosage may be considered 
due to the potential for increased methotrexate toxicity associated with the 
increased exposure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ACE-Inhibitors</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of 
ACE-inhibitors. Oxaprozin has been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
enalapril (significant decrease in dose-adjusted AUC<sub>0-24</sub>
                           <sub/>and C<sub>max</sub>) and 
its active metabolite enalaprilat (significant increase in dose-adjusted 
AUC<sub>0-24</sub>). This interaction should be given consideration 
in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diuretics</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that 
oxaprozin can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some 
patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin 
synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be 
observed closely for signs of renal failure (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS, 
Renal Effects</content>), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lithium</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozin, like other NSAIDs has produced an elevation of plasma lithium 
levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium 
concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by 
approximately 20%. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin 
synthesis by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Thus, when NSAIDs and 
lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for 
signs of lithium toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Glyburide</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While oxaprozin does alter the pharmacokinetics of glyburide, 
coadministration of oxaprozin to type II non-insulin dependent diabetic patients 
did not affect the area under the glucose concentration curve nor the magnitude 
or duration of control. However, it is advisable to monitor patients’ blood 
glucose in the beginning phase of glyburide and oxaprozin cotherapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Warfarin</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are 
synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI 
bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>H<sub>2</sub>-receptor Antagonists</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The total body clearance of oxaprozin was reduced by 20% in subjects who 
concurrently received therapeutic doses of cimetidine or ranitidine; no other 
pharmacokinetic parameter was affected. A change of clearance of this magnitude 
lies within the range of normal variation and is unlikely to produce a 
clinically detectable difference in the outcome of therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Beta-Blockers</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Subjects receiving 1200 mg oxaprozin QD with 100 mg metoprolol bid exhibited 
statistically significant but transient increases in sitting and standing blood 
pressures after 14 days. Therefore, as with all NSAIDs, routine blood pressure 
monitoring should be considered in these patients when starting oxaprozin 
therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Other Drugs</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The coadministration of oxaprozin and antacids, acetaminophen, or conjugated 
estrogens resulted in no statistically significant changes in pharmacokinetic 
parameters in single- and/or multiple-dose studies. The interaction of oxaprozin 
with cardiac glycosides has not been studied.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been 
reported in patients taking oxaprozin. This is due to lack of specificity of the 
screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days 
following discontinuation of oxaprozin therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish oxaprozin from 
benzodiazepines.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In oncogenicity studies, oxaprozin administration for 2 years was 
associated with the exacerbation of liver neoplasms (hepatic adenomas and

of this species-specific finding to man is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozin did not display mutagenic potential. Results from the Ames test, 
forward mutation in yeast and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, DNA repair 
testing in CHO cells, micronucleus testing in mouse bone marrow, chromosomal 
aberration testing in human lymphocytes, and cell transformation testing in 
mouse fibroblast all showed no evidence of genetic toxicity or cell-transforming 
ability.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozin administration was not associated with impairment of fertility in 
male and female rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (1180 mg/m<sup>2</sup>); the usual human dose is 17 mg/kg/day (629 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). However, testicular degeneration was observed in beagle 
dogs treated with 37.5 to 150 mg/kg/day (750 to 3000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) of oxaprozin for 6 months, or 37.5 mg/kg/day for 42 days, a 
finding not confirmed in other species. The clinical relevance of this finding 
is not known.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Teratology studies with oxaprozin were performed in mice, rats, and rabbits. 
In mice and rats, no drug-related developmental abnormalities were observed at 
50 to 200 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (225 to 900 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). 
However, in rabbits, infrequent malformed fetuses were observed in dams treated 
with 7.5 to 30 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin (the usual human dosage range). Animal 
reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no 
adequate or    well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Oxaprozin should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risks 
to the fetus.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 
years of age have not been established. The effectiveness of oxaprozin for the 
treatment of the signs and symptoms of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in 
pediatric patients aged 6-16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and 
well controlled studies in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, and is based on 
an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of oxaprozin in adults with 
rheumatoid arthritis and the similarity in the course of the disease and the 
drug’s mechanism of effect between these two patient populations. Use of 
oxaprozin in JRA patients 6-16 years of age is also supported by the following 
pediatric studies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic profile and tolerability of oxaprozin were assessed in 
JRA patients relative to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients in a 14 day 
multiple dose pharmacokinetic study. Apparent clearance of unbound oxaprozin in 
JRA patients was reduced compared to adult rheumatoid arthritis patients, but 
this reduction could be accounted for by differences in body weight (see <content styleCode="bold">Pharmacokinetics, Pediatric Patients</content>). No pharmacokinetic data 
are available for pediatric patients under 6 years. Adverse events were reported 
by approximately 45% of JRA patients versus an approximate 30% incidence of 
adverse events in the adult rheumatoid arthritis patient cohort. Most of the 
adverse events were related to the gastrointestinal tract and were mild to 
moderate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 3 month open label study, 10 - 20 mg/kg/day of oxaprozin were 
administered to 59 JRA patients. Adverse events were reported by 58% of JRA 
patients. Most of those reported were generally mild to moderate, tolerated by 
the patients, and did not interfere with continuing treatment. Gastrointestinal 
symptoms were the most frequently reported adverse effects and occurred at a 
higher incidence than those historically seen in controlled studies in adults. 
Fifty-two patients completed 3 months of treatment with a mean daily dose of 20 
mg/kg. Of 30 patients who continued treatment (19 - 48 week range total 
treatment duration), nine (30%) experienced rash on sun-exposed areas of the 
skin and 5 of those discontinued treatment. Controlled clinical trials with 
oxaprozin in pediatric patients have not been conducted.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No adjustment of the dose of oxaprozin is necessary in the 
elderly for pharmacokinetic reasons, although many elderly may need to receive a 
reduced dose because of low body weight or disorders associated with aging. No 
significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profile for oxaprozin were seen 
in studies in the healthy elderly (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, 
Special Populations</content>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the total number of subjects evaluated in four placebo controlled clinical 
studies of oxaprozin, 39% were 65 and over, and 11% were 75 and over. No overall 
differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and 
younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified 
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater 
sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although selected elderly patients in controlled clinical trials tolerated as 
well as younger patients, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly, 
and extra care should be taken when choosing a dose. As with any NSAID, the 
elderly are likely to tolerate adverse reactions less well than younger 
patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxaprozin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic 
reactions to oxaprozin may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care 
should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal 
function (see <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS, Renal Effects</content>).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Adverse reaction data were derived from patients who received 
oxaprozin in multidose, controlled, and open-label clinical trials, and from 
worldwide marketing experience. Rates for events occurring in more than 1% of 
patients, and for most of the less common events, are based on 2253 patients who 
took 1200 to 1800 mg oxaprozin per day in clinical trials. Of these, 1721 were 
treated for at least 1 month, 971 for at least 3 months, and 366 for more than 1 
year. Rates for the rarer events and for events reported from worldwide 
marketing experience are difficult to estimate accurately and are only listed as 
less than 1%.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>No patient experienced either an accidental or intentional 
overdosage of oxaprozin in the clinical trials of the drug. Symptoms following 
acute overdose with other NSAIDs are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, 
nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain and are generally reversible with 
supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding and coma have occurred following 
NSAID overdose. Hypertension, acute renal failure, and respiratory depression 
are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion 
of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an 
NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Gut decontamination may be 
indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or 
following a large overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). This should be 
accomplished via emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults,  1 to 
2 g/kg in children) with an osmotic cathartic. Forced diuresis, alkalization of 
the urine, or hemoperfusion would probably not be useful due to the high degree 
of protein binding of oxaprozin.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>As with other NSAIDs, the lowest dose should be sought for each 
patient. Therefore, after observing the response to initial therapy with 
oxaprozin, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual 
patient’s needs. In osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage should be individualized to the lowest 
effective dose of oxaprozin to minimize adverse effects. The <content styleCode="bold">maximum </content>recommended total daily dose of oxaprozin tablets in 
adults is 1800 mg (26 mg/kg, whichever is lower) in divided doses. In children, 
doses greater than 1200 mg have not been studied.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients of low body weight should initiate therapy with 600 mg once daily. 
Patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis should also initiate 
therapy with 600 mg once daily. If there is insufficient relief of symptoms in 
such patients, the dose may be cautiously increased to 1200 mg, but only with 
close monitoring (see <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#section-"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special 
Populations</linkHtml>
                     </content>). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In adults, in cases where a quick onset of action is important, the 
pharmacokinetics of oxaprozin allow therapy to be started with a one-time 
loading dose of 1200 to 1800 mg (not to exceed 26 mg/kg). Doses larger than 1200 
mg/day on a chronic basis should be reserved for patients who weigh more than 50 
kg, have normal renal and hepatic function, are at low risk of peptic ulcer, and 
whose severity of disease justifies maximal therapy. Physicians should ensure 
that patients are tolerating doses in the 600 to 1200 mg/day range without 
gastroenterologic, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic adverse effects before 
advancing to the larger doses. Most patients will tolerate once-a-day dosing 
with oxaprozin, although divided doses may be tried in patients unable to 
tolerate single doses.</paragraph>
